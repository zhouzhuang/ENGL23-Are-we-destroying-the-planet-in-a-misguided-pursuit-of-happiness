My favorite part of the film “Happy” was the lifestyles shown in other countries which definitely served to contrast many aspects of American lifestyle touted as part of the American dream. Of course, more money for essentially unlimited consumerism, owning a bigger house and luxury vehicles, etc. are often portrayed  as par for the course when it comes to the pursuit of happiness but this film really shows that that is simply not the case. That is a vision that has originated from a materialistically oriented America and is clearly more of a cultural thing. Also, like Ken mentioned, the irony is even when we obtain financial security and prosperity as well as material gain, it still feels like not enough and we’re still not happy. In essence, if we prioritize material gain as the key to personal fulfillment, we will never find “happiness”. Currently, I feel like the way the American dream is portrayed leads many to waste their entire lives chasing an illusion that will never be as rewarding as it is made to seem. 

<br><br>
This film has really made me reflect upon what happiness is. First, I looked up the word “happy” in the dictionary and found the following definitions: #1 Having a sense of confidence in or satisfaction with (a person, arrangement, or situation). #2 Satisfied with the quality or standard of. #3 Willing to do something. 
<br><br>


Using these baselines, I think each and everyone one of us should reflect upon what our definition of happiness — which people often seem to align with their own definition of success, both of which are extremely personal visions — because as young adults, the decisions we make are misguided in the sense that we are also positioning ourselves for a life spent chasing material gain in the place of personal fulfillment. Of course, struggling financially makes life difficult and can arguably inhibit happiness through stress, but once a certain threshold of financial stability is met (depending on where you choose to live), I think we can set aside the mentality of “how can I make more money?” and really start to think about “what can I do which will make life more meaningful to me?” And this epiphany is perhaps one of the important realizations that I’ve come to in this class.

I adored your comment and I totally agree. Our general public has figured out how to adapt our bliss. They tell us we need every one of these things to be upbeat and improve our lives, and we trust it. The story grows by a large portion of us getting fixated on trying sincerely and turning out to be 'effective' and 'rich'. It miserable on the grounds that we're in effect totally misinformed. What stood apart to me when I saw this film was all the science behind the idea of satisfaction. I discovered that we are actually brought into the world with qualities that decide a scope of our joy. We can do that by finding our stream and investing significant energy with loved ones, not continually attempting to get more cash-flow.

 I completely agree with you. As the film states, once our basic needs are met, our pursuits are essentially selfish. I liked how the film pointed out that only 10% of our happiness is determined by our personal circumstances, while 40% was determined by the actions we chose to take. Watching the woman who got run over by the truck completely grounded me. She may have lost her “external beauty” but to me she looked glowing with life and happiness, surrounded by the things she loves and not consumed by a false pursuit of satisfaction. I feel that as American’s, we’re taught to chase milestones like graduating high school, going to college, getting married, getting our first big job, but as the film said these accomplishments only provide fleeting happiness. It is upsetting that many people waste their lives searching for happiness that seems to flee.
<br><br>

What’s interesting is that we are social beings, yet when ideas like democratic socialism arise, many are scared. Sharing and providing for the collective good seems to be meeting our own needs yet also fulfilling the needs of others. I’m not sure why this is such a radical idea. 
<br><br>

I think it’s important to ponder the question you asked in your comment. I know many college students, myself included, who have pondered the question of why we’re even in school. The classes become too hard and maybe you realize that you don’t really want to be stuck in the major you’re in, but you feel that you need your degree to fulfill some type of career goal. It’s important to make sure each action is done with the intent of achieving happiness. In my ethics class, we learned that the only thing that is intrinsically valuable (meaning that it is valuable in and of itself) is happiness, and all of our choices are motivated by achieving happiness. For me, learning is extremely fulfilling in itself. Being sensitive to others and having a more worldly perspective makes me feel grounded. I think that most people know that money doesn’t always equate to happiness, but it seems it becomes addicting, acquiring more and demonstrating one’s “achievements”.

This! I would absolutely agree that the film did a great job of challenging how we define happiness in America. There were so many examples of people living incredibly modestly or having jobs that our society portrays as "unsuccessful", but they were way happier than the average American. I think that there are also so many things that American's sacrifice all in the name of “happiness”. People either work endlessly to gain an income that meets a baseline, or they work their lives away because that is how success is defined. I think that both of these examples need to be fixed. Firstly no working person should be living paycheck to paycheck, we need to revamp our capitalist system so that simply staying alive does not require one to work themselves to death. Secondly we need to reimagine the idea that work equates to success and happiness. Sure some people enjoy their job, but I guarantee that many others are just trying to climb the corporate ladder to try to gain happiness. What if instead of working these long hours, people spent more time outside, or doing hobbies, or spending time with family and friends? I think American happiness would sky rocket.
 <br><br>

The film Happy reminds me a lot of the Economy of Plenitude video. I think if we could mold America to follow that system, that people would be a lot happier.

I loved your comment! This film accurately portrayed the impact of material wealth on personal happiness, and your comment made me reflect on what I do in my life to make me happy. I personally love going to school. I love the "hustle and bustle" of being a biology major (which is extremely impacted and difficult). I love going to my classes and putting in time to receive good grades. Working towards my future and always yearning for knowledge genuinely gives me a sense of motivation and happiness. However, I do enjoy gaining happiness from materialistic things. I'll admit that I do get very happy when I purchase a new article of clothing to add to my wardrobe, or a new pair of sneakers to wear to the gym. After almost finishing a whole quarter in English 23, I've realized that I need to stop partaking in the guilty pleasure of shopping. For me to receive just a mere feeling of excitement from opening a package, so many people in developing worlds have to suffer. The manufacturing of most products sold in the United States are made in places that do not promote ethical practices towards their employees, while also exploiting multiple limited resources. In addition, the air travel for the product to arrive in California is extremely harmful for the environment. Thus, I have cut back my "shopping addiction" and have committed myself to only buying what I need. If I do need to buy something, I try to buy from companies that are ethical and sustainable, such as Patagonia. Just recently, I decided that I needed to purchase a new backpack because I am constantly bringing two bags to school since all of my daily necessities do not fit in my current one. I knew that buying another backpack contributes to consumerism and definitely does not benefit the environment, so I tried to think of ways to offset my actions. I went through my closet and found numerous articles of clothing that I simply do not wear anymore or have outgrown. I was able to sell all of them on the Free and For Sale page for modest prices, which helped me to "get rid" of some of my stuff before my new backpack would come and also allows other people to shop second hand. This gave me a burst of joy because I was able to let others shop from my closet instead of first hand from a retailer. I hope to continue this exercise of happiness as I accumulate more things in my life.

I like the fact that you brought up the definition of happiness. I wholeheartedly agree that it is important to meditate on how we define happiness personally, and also see how that compares to what society deems as the source of happiness. The third definition of “willing to do something” really spoke to me and connected to the part of the movie about giving back. One of the interviewees said,  “We all need something bigger than ourselves to care about.” I think that thinking outside of ourselves, which the American dream doesn’t often let us do, is necessary to happiness. The American dream puts us in a box and hinders us from deep human connection, but rather an unhealthy connection to money and material stuff. Another quote from the movie was that “We’re told in our society that the way to be a competent person, to be a good person, is to make a lot of money.” This mindset further fuels capitalism and the destructive fossil fuel industries that run our lives. This movie inspires the idea that we must not be selfish and we should find time to focus on working for the happiness of others and for the world. This mindset is important in the fight for climate change. While fighting for this cause and making daily decisions we can be boosting our happiness by being conscious of something greater than ourselves.

Amazing content.

One funny thing: people are bad at predicting how happy some things will make them. Yeah, keep buying more things. It’s advertised as though it’ll make you happy. One time, I was happy because I ate a good watermelon. I wanted more watermelon though. I was unsatisfied. “Next time, I’ll eat a whole watermelon. More watermelon, more happiness. My dream is to eat a whole watermelon with a spoon. I wanna eat watermelons all day! I can’t get enough watermelons!” I fulfilled my life's desire. After finishing the watermelon, I just felt full but unsatisfied. I expected too much from it for it to be good enough. I think happiness comes when we don’t expect it. It’s not chasing happiness when you’re eating watermelon, or wanting more watermelon so you can be happy. It’s being happy while you’re eating the watermelon. Fully tasting it and feeling it. It’s being happy when you’re not eating the watermelon too. Just being happy in the present.

What a nice film to watch, especially right before finals. I’m so glad we’re watching this instead of Fire in Paradise. Thank you Ken. I want to be happy. I want to be happy with other people and have warm relationships and help others and have time to do what I like and get into “flow” and be calmer. It’s not the Stuff that I want though. I want to be happy with the people I love, I want to be curious and see things as novel again, like the man in the bayou enjoying nature. I want to be happy when I see people’s faces light up as they greet me, like that man who pulls people on wagons. Before watching this film, I thought that to be happy, I have to do well in school and try hard. It felt like there’s no time to do things I enjoy, or see things from a kid’s perspective. After watching this film and learning about flow, I think I can enjoy learning. I enjoy learning, just not the pressure of having to do well or else I fail and disappoint people I care about. I think part of it is just guilt that I’ve been slacking though. The things we sacrifice to be “happy”. Work harder, work more, give up leisure time, give up socializing with people. To be happy, later. It makes sense. Play now, or play later. It’s not to the extremes though. It’s hard to decide when there’s in betweens. I guess for now, I need to focus on flow and being in the present instead of being sad that I’m not at home or anxious and dreadful about exams and grades, or frustrated and guilty that I didn’t do as well. Just be in the present, happy that I’m learning.

In fact, when I watched the movie happy, I really thought about the relationship between happy and climate change, but when I watched it, I found that it was actually connected at a deeper level. The film tells how people in other countries and regions define happiness and think they are happy. They don't all make a lot of money, but these people are happy. According to the survey data given, Americans rank 29th in the 2019 global happiness index, but their carbon emissions are also at the forefront, accounting for 25% of the total global emissions. However, the top few people who have been happy all the time do not have very high carbon emissions in their countries. This seems to be understandable to me. Just like the situation in the United States, China has the same phenomenon. It pays too much attention to development. Everyone lives a life of tension and high pressure. Every day, the motivation is to earn money to support his family rather than to be happy. This may be the cost of excessive carbon emission development and increasing pressure on the earth. According to this movie, we really should slow down the pace of carbon emission pollution and try to touch the simple happy life.

I agree with you! The different lifestyles is what really struck with me because coming from a pretty poor background I have experienced this idea in my own way. It is so eye opening and inspiring to see people who have it “worse” than us but still be happier than most people. Really makes you consider what is really “better” vs “worse”. Materialism is a serious disease our country struggles with especially around the holidays and it is hurting our mental health and our planet. I really like that you looked up the definition of the word happy really helps put into perspective what it is that people are truly chasing. Happiness is not the same as success and I honestly believe that it is necessary to find true happiness in order to be truly successful. People truly need to search on magnifying the meaningfulness of their life rather than the amount of materialistic goods they can count. Stoicism has this idea that the point of life isn’t to not have any materialistic goods but to achieve a point in life where if materialistic goods were taken away, your happiness and mental stability would not alter. I always think of this idea and what is the foundation and source of my happiness as well as what drives me.

<br><hr>
The lifestyles of other people was one of my favorite parts about the film too. The people were living so minimal yet they were so happy. Since the very beginning with the rickshaw driver in India the film caught my attention. It was such a contrast with how people in America imagine what happiness is. We really are so focused on material things and the consumerism lifestyle as being what would make us happy but yes the film shows the opposite of what it means to be happy. I agree, even after achieving all these things people are not happy because once they get tired of what they have gotten they want more. The irony really is that no matter how much wealth and things they gain it will never be enough to become any happier. 
 <br><br>
There was a part where it talked about intrinsic people who are happier than those with money because they focus more on personal growth, relationships, and helping their community. I think that focusing on what you do have and sharing is what makes people happy. I know that the couple of times I have helped my community out I have felt very happy. The whole act of giving to those who aren't as fortunate as you and just seeing how happy you helping them makes them feel makes you feel even more grateful. 
 <br><br>
Again I agree, we should reflect on what we think happiness means to us. Usually when asked the cliche answer is always materialistic; money, big house, clothes. But you ask ourselves that question you mentioned “what can I do to make life more meaningful” our perspective will change. That is when we will actually become happy, when we think beyond the materialistic things.

<br><hr>
Yeah, even though this film doesn’t tell us about environmental protection, it really elaborates on what makes us happy. Since happiness is the goal for everyone. The US is destroying the Earth with tremendous pollution and co2 emission even though the per person happiness is not that high. In the film, we see Japan, people working hard till death for earning money, but they are never happy. I mean I am quite shocked when I see the film, those trains pass by and every face shown on the window is tired and sorrowful. That's quite pitiful, and the sharper contrast is with Putin, a nation far less developed than Japan, they got so happy as they had a unique way for national development, they do not care about GDP, but national happiness instead. Additionally, I am really looking forward to Sweden's co-housing way of living, because it is the most efficient way to live lives, everyone cooks every 2 months for the whole 20 families. It is uneasy to develop a way into cooperation when you think about the japanese village, they were initially driven to help each other by WWII. After the film, I was thinking about my purchasing habit, it is indeed inefficient, and I am just unconsciously buying stuff and they don’t matter much to me and my happiness. I think I will get rid of it soon by consciously control my purchasing behaviors.
<br><hr>
I really enjoyed your commentary, especially because I strongly believe that people are happy because of what they can make out of their situations. My mother grew up in a very humble lifestyle in Brazil, but she was extremely happy during that time. She didn’t have the world’s most expensive toys, her parents didn’t live in a thousand acre home and she had to share every single thing she owned with her 2 siblings, and still she was a super happy child. I believe that a media strongly catered to appease the industry has made us believe that we need all these different things to be happy, a new car, hundreds of toys, a new kitchen, when in reality if we were able to appreciate all the things we already have, we’d live much healthier and fulfilling lives. And the fact that most of us watch TV and are exposed to this from a young age makes this ingrained into our brains. We need to re-evaluate what we're doing with our time and money and invest in things that truly matter.
  <br><br>

As the movie puts into real figures, the difference in happiness between someone that makes 5,000 and 50,000 is tremendous but the difference between those who make 50,000 and 5,000,000 is almost non-existent.

<br><hr>
This movie made me realize that I need to think about something more valuable: how to live happier and make my life more meaningful. Happiness is a valuable treasure to human beings. Nowaydays, scientists are studying how happiness works. There is even an area called positive psychology that study happiness. Three factors decide how happy we are: genes, circumstance, and intentional activity. It is hard to change our genes and the circumstances we are in, so what we choose to do is the only way that we can control to make ourselves happier. Our society teaches us making a lot of money is a reflection of succeed and happiness. However, the economics grow much more rapidly than before, but the level of happiness among human beings stays the same for so many years. When it arrives to a certain level, more money does not equal to more happiness. Scientists found that happy people tended to have close friends and families. In the documentary, an old men were having dinner with his old family members. They talked and laughed, and we can easily found they were so happy. The happiest country on earth is Denmark. People in there lived in co-housing communities so they can help each other. In this way, humans can shift from what they don’t have to what they have and can give to others. Compassion is in our blood. When we are offering helps, we can easily feel happy. We need to think something out of and bigger than ourselves.

The film "Happy" has been by far one of my favorite movies in this class. I cried; I laughed; I smiled. This movie had a powerful message that needed to be transmit to everyone: be happy. Many people, including myself, have been victims of what society classifies as a person who is happy. The constant media advertisements that we see on a daily basis are literally brainwashing our brains to make us think that happiness is only measure by someone's success in life. In fact, the environment is only responsible for 10% of our happiness and the other 90% is determined by both our genes and the actions we choose to do. 
  <br><br>

Most of the time, we are in a perpetual cycle in which we set a goal, achieve it, makes us happy and then this happiness dissipates. In turn, we set more ambitious and ridiculous goals which ultimately require to work ourselves to death in other to achieve them. Money is one of the main factors of "happiness" yet across the world, there are people who live in poorer, and worst conditions than the average American and yet they are happy. I believe that many of these people value their family and social connections than just money. We need to redefine our definition of happiness. 
  <br><br>

As a Biology major, I am fascinated on how the body works. I found the part of dopamine to be very interesting. This neurotransmitter which is release by neurons and make us happy. We effectively increase the production of dopamine by doing activities that fulfills the soul and make us happy. As we grow older, we produce less dopamine and it makes sense. The older we get, the sadder we also get. This has to do because we work longer hours to pay our financial burdens; thus, depleting our dopamine and neurons.
  <br><br>

One of the scenes that struck me the most and at first might seem to not be related to climate change was when all the middle school kids were at the gym. This is the part where I cried. Seeing all those students who suffered from bullying was just heartbreaking. I believe that in order to be the change, we need to start educating kids at schools to not destroy someone else's life. This makes the victims live in constant depression, depleting their dopamine levels. By inflicting pain to others, we are acting the future of our planet. We need to build social relationships to one another at a young age in order to work together in the future.
<br><hr>
I agreed with most of your comment; but I have to disagree on that last bit. While yes, there are some people who constantly look for ways to make excessive amounts of money, I also believe that people in certain professions should be compensated very well. One example is a physician. Doctors go to school for 8 years (at least!) after high school, plus an additional 4-8 years of training. Ultimately, they end up making a very good amount of money, likely more than they really need despite wherever they choose to live. However, they absolutely deserve every penny, and there are people in many other professions that I could say the same about. So, while we maybe don't need billions of dollars, I also think we shouldn't limit ourselves to only making as much money as we can just get by on.
<br><hr>
I love what you said here about happiness in general. During high school, I definitely felt like I was chasing this sense of "happiness" by owning material goods. I would love to buy new clothes, tech, etc. Sure after buying one of these items I felt a sense of short-term happiness but then it slowly faded away and the cycle repeated. I was stuck into the trap of American consumerism's image of happiness. Thankfully now, throughout my first year in college I've started to get away from this false sense of happiness. I was beginning to find happiness in the things I did rather than the things I owned. Taking Ken's class this quarter further pushed my mentality forward and it has developed it so much more no just for the benefit of myself but for the environment. Watching the film "Happy" definitely exemplified this point. I've stopped prioritizing material gains and I've noticed my experiences of happiness and that like the definition you mention of having confidence/satisfaction and my willingness to do new things and explore life has expanded that much more since developing this new form of happiness.

<br><hr>
thank you for replying to my comment. In response, I would like to expand upon your mentioning of doctor salaries, and provide further clarification to expand upon my comment above. I completely agree with you! Considering I’m actually a pre-med student myself right now, I definitely believe that there should be variation in the salary given to those working in various professions. The fact that there is more money to be earned in specific professions is not at all something I take issue with! 

  <br><br>

For instance, while on average doctors do get paid more than perhaps an accountant, I think that it’s completely justified because of how many years of additional education doctors must first acquire before they can begin practicing medicine. Not to mention that those years of education are extremely expensive. As I said, I’m a pre-med student right now and if doctors weren’t paid more than another career that required less years of school, I doubt I would actually choose to go to medical school and become a doctor simply because it wouldn’t make sense from a both a time spent and financial perspective. 
  <br><br>


Another factor when it comes to the disparity between the average salary of different professions could also be selectivity. Keeping with the doctors example, the process to actually get accepted to med school is extremely selective and when it comes to doctors, demand far exceeds supply in America so once again, of course doctors should be paid more relative to other professions. 

  <br><br>

The main point I was trying to make in my above comment which I’m hoping to clarify for everyone in the course here, is not that everyone regardless of their profession should receive equal compensation. Personally, I would not find that fair at all and it’s not in line with either my personal or political views. Instead, my main message to myself and to others which I reflected upon after watching this film is that when it comes to choosing what we major in or which career we choose to go into, I don’t think we should only consider average salary because at the end of the day lots of money won’t make you happy if you don’t enjoy what you’re doing. At every pre-health panel I’ve attended and every doctor I’ve spoken to have stated that if you’re going into medicine for the money, then you shouldn’t go into medicine. And people who want to go into the arts only because they seek fame will be disappointed as well because the harsh reality (work days that are often more than 12 hours long, and it requires rigorous self-discipline because one false note and you risk being replaced, not to mention the lack of control over the trajectory of your own career) won’t live up to the overly glamorous depictions of such a career.

  <br><br>

Basically, part of being happy is feeling fulfilled and since we’ve established that money alone cannot make life seem meaningful, it is important to pursue the things that we’re actually passionate about and interested in. Of course, given the society we live in, money will always be a factor to consider at the bare minimum for survival purposes, but money alone should not drive our decisions. After all, more money does not equal more happiness. Thank you again :)
<br><hr>

I totally agree. People today seem to have forgotten some of the aspects of their lives that will truly give them happiness. That they have forgotten their own definition of happiness. While it is not the same for everyone, most people seem to know that there's more to life than money and material objects. Although the biggest problem with this is that people seem to forget that idea.
  <br><br>

I think where the film “Happy” really hit me, was when it was talking about the Japanese family. The father worked so much for his family, that he never really had the opportunity to even see them. He eventually just worked himself to death and his family had to move on without him. He knew that he was working for his family, but was the cost really worth it? I just wish that he could have realized that his family was more important than all of the money he was earning for them.


<br><hr>
I find this film to be powerful in truly defining and setting examples of what it means to be happy. This film includes stories of individuals who search for meaning and fulfillment. Many of the people in this film are happy with the life they have, even when they face adversity. These people have found purpose and form their happiness based on what they value in life, whether it is family, friends, hobbies, nature, etc. Throughout this film I sat and contemplated one of the questions that might not be always asked, "What truly makes us happy?" I appreciate this film for showing us that happiness is something that we can create and find, whether it is by building relationships, finding something we are passionate about, or by being grateful. I really like how you connect the topic of happiness with the idea of "chasing an illusion." It is true, in regards to the American lifestyle, society established the idea that one can only be happy by having the best and large quantities of things. Happiness is not achieved by wanting more. Happiness is something we find within this world that goes beyond the material world.
  <br><br>

Furthermore, I would like to add on to your last comment on how we define happiness. A question that comes to mind is, "how many times in a day do people reflect and note to themselves the things that make them happy?" I believe that by making this reflection, we can truly find out what makes us happy, and in what ways we can preserve our happiness. I find your last question to have strong significance. We should always ask ourselves, "What can I do which will make life more meaningful to me?" A thing to emphasize in our world, is the question, "how many of us and the people around us actually take the time to find the reasons for happiness?"

<br><hr>
I agree with you about the contrast between happiness in different countries.  As seen in the film people in other countries were happy for reasons the average American probably would not be.  I think this connects to the idea of consumerism being compared to happiness.  The less fortunate countries have fewer "things" to make them happy so they never experienced the enjoyment of these things so they have other ways to have fun and be happy and those activities usually do not require anything materialistic.  Many Americans are tied to material things to bring happiness and enjoyment and those things cost money to the idea of money bringing happiness could apply in the U.S. because there is always a new thing to buy in the U.S. and that is simply not available in the other countries.

<br><hr>
I also thought it was super interesting to contrast the American lifestyle to other countries' lifestyles. The American pursuit of happiness and other countries' pursuits of happiness are very different. I believe that the American pursuit of happiness that is outlined in our Declaration of Independence is very different than it is now. It is now based on wealth rather than back in the day it was most likely just being financially stable and then finding your happiness apart from that. When I think about my pursuit of happiness, it involves me working a lot in order to accumulate wealth. Maybe this isn't right. Maybe I should go travel the world and do odd jobs until I'm older. However, this going against the grain is scary, and it is often frowned upon by our elders. 
  <br><br>


Thank you for saying "What can I do which will make life more meaningful to me?" I think this is something so important and we don't listen to it enough. Honestly we don't need more than just financial stability in our lives. There are other ways to find our happiness, and that is why this question is so important. In this last quarter, I have found myself asking that question a lot. I really want to find parts of my life that truly make me happy that don't rely on making/having wealth, or are part of schoolwork. I want to find points in my life that I can go to at any time in my life in order to make myself happier. Now, I think I will add another part to these restrictions. I think this happiness should also be sustainable and not contribute to the climate crisis, because is it really making me happy if its hurting our planet? No. It isn't.

It is sad that many Americans firmly believe that money will make them happier, because not only does following this belief make them unhappy, it greatly contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions of America, which is in turn creating problems for the rest of the world.  
  <br><br>
I believe that in the future Americans will be able to reduce their carbon footprint as it is easier for the younger generations to change their mind about the belief that money equals happiness.  Knowing that there is a specific annual income where you can comfortably live without suffering from not having enough money will help to encourage people to live their life with happiness as their goal rather than money.  The problem is that in America, we are taught that we need to make money in order to be happy, which is not wrong, as we do need to have money in order to live.  The issue lies in the belief that the more money you make, the happier you will be.  This in turn leads to excessive buying and the belief that you need to keep buying more because whatever you already own is not good enough.
  <br><br>
The documentary helped greatly in allowing me to see that there are people who live comfortably even though they are not extremely wealthy.  You can tell people that having money does not guarantee they will be happy, but they will not believe so unless they actually see how someone with little money can live a happy life.  Although America is such a wealthy country, America is not the happiest country because we care so much about making money.  As an American, it surprised me so much to see people are not wealthy yet are still content with their lives and have no intention of making changes to their lives to make themselves more wealthy.

In response to this comment, yes the contrast of other lifestyles in comparison to the American lifestyle was a great touch to the film. It does a great job of exploiting Americans for wanting luxuries that undoubtedly harm the environment. These things include a larger house, a better car, nicer clothes, etc. The worst part is the consumerism never ends... and that's what the film did a good job of exploiting. It also does an exceptional job at displaying these different lifestyles across the globe that focus on things like happiness and personal fulfillment. For me personally, I feel the film did a great job at separating material wealth and personal fulfillment. In American culture the two seem to be constantly intertwined. So seeing these two topics break away from each other and be shown each in their own light was neat. It really makes you realize how strict your mindset can actually be. Answering the question of "what can I do to make my life more meaningful for me," seems to be a more prominent question in the American culture. In the years to come, it may be a leading question in peoples minds.
<br><hr>
I wholeheartedly agree with your assessment that people in first-world developed countries must redefine happiness around something other than material goods in order to live sustainable and fulfilling lives, but I would also like to elaborate on the point you made that it seems there is a certain baseline of financial stability that is needed for happiness. The larger scale issue that this baseline of financial stability, in third world undeveloped countries, cannot be reached by commonfolk except by explicit use of fossil fuels. If we in the developed world are to truly tackle the climate crisis from an economically stable standpoint, we must 1) roll back on our own consumerism and 2) establish the infrastructure and support in third world countries to ensure they do not need fossil fuels to reach financial stability. If we do not carry out point 2, no matter how much we change our lifestyles, our climate will still be destroyed by those whose economies require the use of fossil fuels.
<br><hr>
I loved your comment and completely agreed. I think that most people chase after the idea of the american dream but never feel fulfilled. The idea of consumerism, a heavily discussed idea in this class, never fully makes someone happy. I thought it was really interesting how they mentioned dopamine and how we can do certain activities that release more of it. I think it is important to remember that we are capable of changing our lives and doing things that make us happier. Along these lines, I was devastated to learn about how many people are working to death in Japan. Universally, we have created a culture that puts work above happiness, creating serious consequences. As young people entering into the work force, we have the responsibility to change the culture we live in. 
   <br><br>

I too, feel that this class has made me look at the world differently. I am trying to do things that make life more meaningful to me, instead of going through the motions everyday. Things like participating in activism, protesting for what I believe in, and standing up for what I am passionate about makes life more meaningful to me. I definitely am one of those people who place work and school above my happiness. This class has allowed me to take a step back and think about what truly makes me happy.

<br><hr>
I really like your comment, especially the last paragraph is so insightful. I think that everyone has their own idea of what happiness should be, as illustrated in the film. This is why different things meet people's standards of happiness; there is no one universal goal. I think that the culture we grow up and live in certainly shapes our idea of what happiness looks like. Here in America, I agree with you that America is materialistically oriented. Our consumer culture tells us that having things, whether it be a house or a new car, will make us happy. I always think about celebrities who had all these things and still speak about suffering from sadness and depression as well as those who have committed suicide. I think these tragic cases prove that material wealth does not guarantee, or really even lead to true happiness. This should help us to recognize that we can give up material things that we do not need because they will not make us happy. We do not need to increase our carbon footprint just because American culture tells us it will bring us satisfaction.
<br><hr>
I also enjoyed the part of the film where lifestyles of different countries were shown to contrast the American lifestyle. It goes to show that more does not necessarily mean better. In this case, accumulating more stuff does not mean a better lifestyle, especially shown in this film introduction made by Ken. I was surprised that seven countries on the planet with the happiest people have climate footprints that are less than ours despite living in areas that are relatively cold, and thus require more energy to stay warm. It is definitely ironic that our happiness has decreased despite releasing more greenhouse gas emissions. There are many people in this world who have significantly less wealth than the average American. Despite this, they have the same level of happiness. This part also made me reflect upon what happiness is and my own definition of happiness. Before this class, my goal after college was to find an amazing job that will allow me to make a lot of money, so that I can provide for my future family and be happy. However, this video showed me that I do not need that high level of wealth to have an overall happy family. This definitely made me reconsider my future and what I actually want in life to be happy, which I will continue to ponder about even after this class.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. I feel like once I make enough money, I have to think about ways to make my life happier. What I am understanding is that having more stuff will not give me happiness. I feel that my  main happiness is coming from improving myself and helping people. I now work out which gives me happiness because I see my growth in my body. Having that confidence in me happiness and makes me want to improve in other aspects in my life. I also do my hair which makes me feel great in being public. Improving is a great way for me to gain confidence and be happy. With people I don't only want to give them gifts or money to be happy. I want to be there for them and always want to help people in situations. There are always solutions and I want to give solutions for peoples problems to make them happy. This will give me true happiness but still needs work. I can also make a lot of people happy throughout the world If I focus on my climate footprint. As Ken basically said, less carbon footprint, More happiness. It will give me happiness and will prevent people to be affected by climate change.

<br><hr>
After watching this movie two years ago in APES I have often referenced the "definition of happiness" provided in the movie. People's responses vary but usually, it sounds something like this, "well sure but they're not "really" happy" followed by "would you be happy if you had to live in a small hut in Bangladesh" Of course I respond by citing the film where it mentions that there still exists a baseline level of wealth before you can be truly happy. But I don't think this entirely addresses their point. In America, we were literally raised to be consumers. Americans assume that wealth accumulation and wanting to be richer than everyone is just human nature... but it is not. The examples of Bhutan, Okinawa, and Scandinavia all disprove that. It is only in countries where that government actively chose to prioritize work and productivity over all else that this is the case i.e Japan and the US. And as Catherine mentioned, this pursuit of productivity is not even making us better in the end. It really makes you think, what is the end goal? Presumably, it is that if we increase our growth enough then we'll all be happy in the end. But as our economic growth has increased, wages for the poorest Americans have stagnated and quality of life has actually gotten worse for the majority of Americans in the past 60 years. It all is so futile. Scandinavia is living proof that with a government that cares about its people, it is possible to achieve sustainable growth, high quality of life and take care of the environment.
<br><hr>
The film itself was incredibly interesting, and showed the drastic differences in lives across the globe. As you point out, the film unveils the “American dream” and shows how it harms rather than helps, and how owning bigger houses and bigger cars aren’t ultimately the thing that leads to a better life. Money is good to have when needed, but ultimately it seems as though no human needs a multimillion dollar mansion; financial security only goes so far, and happiness cannot be gained through monetary means. Your point that everyone should reflect on their own happiness was intriguing, and something that I’m interested in doing myself. Everyone has different versions of success.
<br><hr>
I love this comment so much. I don’t think it could’ve been said any better. As Americans we are very materialistic and this documentary showed that. In other countries where they lived in smaller houses and had gardens to grow there own food they were actually happier. We think happiness is bought with fancy cars and big mansions when in reality it isn’t. I also noticed how they mention one of the happiest countries is denmark and then right after said how they have free college tuition and free healthcare for all. We too could have all that if Bernie was president and who knows maybe we could all be happier too. (not to be political but...)
<br><hr>
Great comment! Sometimes I think many people focus on the materialistic things in life to achieve pleasure in life. I like how this film tackled all these issues that are very much alive in our communities. I agree with what you mentioned about the American dream being an illusion for many. I feel that a lot of people are trying to fit in so hard into American culture that it just creates dissatisfaction in their lives. This so-called “American Dream” is just a basis of trends that people follow to fit in and gain “acceptance” into society. It just creates so many unhappy scenarios in which people feel like they have no purpose in following this dream. This illusion like you mentioned isn’t for everyone. People just work and work, forgetting to enjoy life in the process. Not only is this harmful and detrimental for their lives, but it also creates a harm to the environment. The state many live in requires them to work more to maintain their families, but at times they don’t fulfill their desires. Like Ken has mentioned numerous times in lecture and videos, “If the work week is shortened, there will be increased levels of happiness.” It also saves emissions too from those who commute to work for numerous miles. Overall I feel like happiness has a great connection with the way we view the environment.
<br><hr>
I truly resonated with your comment. As a child, my perspective of personal fulfillment was that I need to be rich in order to be happy. However, as I become an adult I am quickly realizing that money does not buy happiness whatsoever. In Psychology I learned that material gains will only make you "happy" for so long before you desire something else to satisfy your happiness levels. I have been really challenging myself this quarter to reconsider the way I view material gains and to consume less. I think this is especially difficult for Americans, as we grew up in a society that told us the that success is dictated by how much you make or the things you have. However, I believe that with enough exposure to films like "Happy" and education about the environment in general, people will realize that, we, as a society are prioritizing the wrong things. The fact that the average person in the United States is 13x more wealthy as the average person in Costa Rica, considering the fact that Costa Rica is higher ranked in happiness, shows that money doesn't in fact buy happiness. There is also the fact that the highest ranked countries in terms of happiness live the most environmentally sustainable. We cannot ignore these facts and instead use these countries as inspiration for massive change in our consumer culture.
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you! I also felt that once people are content with their lives they are able to focus more on living sustainable lives. Even if they aren't doing it for the sake of the planet, the two tend to overlap. There was a scene where the elderly woman felt happy planting her own vegetables without pesticides. It shows that when we focus on ourselves we have more time to take upon hobbies that in turn are better for the planet. Also, a lot of the people in the film who were happy seemed to live slower paced lives. This in turn makes them avoid choosing "faster" options that often have negative effects on our planet. Overall the message of the movie was heartwarming and it definitely made me evaluate my own life. There have been multiple times where I was unhappy with my life and I turned to retail shopping in order to fill that void. However, that wasn't making me feel better or being sustainable for the planet. I think this emphasizes the fact that the climate crisis isn't just about changing our habits to protect the planet but to improve our own lives as well.
<br><hr>
Love your comment. I think it is really interesting to think about the threshold of financial stability. Perhaps, for a lot of Americans, we have trouble seeing the threshold because we are so concerned about growth. It can blur our capability to think of what we truly need, which is so sad. We mask this dissatisfaction with trying to get bigger and better stuff. Which is just not the answer. We spend more time on bettering ourselves so that we can look good on the outside, instead of focusing on building skills that create "flow" and building on our true desires or intrinsic values. Sure, extrinsic activity is, perhaps, what you need to survive or set yourself up for comfortability but intrinsic activities goes far beyond that--they give you a reason to live life, it then seems worth it to you. I have found that when I am doing extrinsic things, I tend to contemplate why I am doing this or wasting my energy on something I don't particularly care for, but when I am doing things that are intrinsic, I feel like I am doing something meaningful. In high school, my mom used to burst in my room asking what I was doing. I would sigh deeply and say I am doing homework (if I had the opportunity to not do it and it would not affect my grades, I would have taken the chance 100%). I am an actor, so throughout high school I was always doing shows or performing in some sort of way. I would be working on a monologue or a scene and just be in the zone! So, when my mom would barge into my room and ask what I was doing and I would tell her, I am working. Which was true but the way I would phrase it, made it sound a lot more meaningful to me. My mom knew I couldn't be bothered during this.

<br><hr>
I too enjoyed seeing how other people were living their lives and were content with what they had. One scene in particular was in the beginning of the film where they show a man in India who is fairly poor financially, but very rich in life. He enjoys the simple pleasures that life has to give and almost makes his life seem “perfect” since he has no real worries. He claims that there are days when all that he and his family has to eat is rice with salt, but he is still happy to have something to eat. This is something that we easily forget. We are always trying to have more than we actually need that we forget to enjoy life’s simple pleasures. They say that money doesn’t buy happiness, and this is true to an extent. You obviously would not want to be completely broke and be living on the streets. You would want to have enough money to at least be able to provide for your family, but there is so much that you don’t need that we assume are basic necessities. If we learn to appreciate what we have we would be consuming less and indirectly helping to reduce co2 emissions.
<br><hr>
I strongly agree with you Catherine and love how you discussed your interpretation of the literal definition of "happy". I liked how this video was not directly related to the climate crisis. However, it gave what we have learned in class an even more holistic perspective. I thought it was fascinating how an extremely poor rickshaw driver in a third world country was just as happy as an average American. This just shows how people in America rely so much on external value for happiness. This refers to materialistic items, money, and career. It seems that true happiness comes from meaning in life. I fully stand by this.
   <br><br>
I've traveled to Denmark many times and the way of living there works way more harmoniously than anywhere else I have been. People bike to work, they live in communal homes, and they spend time with one another. Healthcare and education are covered and people seem less tense. I think by implementing small changes in one's life, many people can achieve this happiness. I think the first major step is being less obsessed with consumer items, status, and monetary values.

<br><hr>
I resonated a lot with your comment here. I believe that the materialistic culture we have here in the US will never change but that's not saying it can't improve. The use of the definitions of happy really makes us rethink what we consider as happy.  Our whole lives we’ve had the idea of happiness being a result of success and money shoved down our throats. Especially as college students we are more now than ever trying to find what makes us truly happy. Because this film challenges the American way of happiness, it grants us a new perspective of what we call happy and it shows us how it can positively affect the climate. Something all people should take from this film is finding internal happiness. If one can find happiness with themselves this can in turn affect the lives of the people around them. I appreciate this film for showing us that happiness is something that we can create and find, whether it is by building relationships, finding something we are passionate about, or by being grateful.
<br><hr>
This documentary really made me reflect on my personal life as well. I have never been a super materialistic personally as I do not come from wealth. Therefore, I have always relied on friends and family to supply me happiness. I do know several people close to me who live extremely materialistic lifestyles, and while I am not judging, I do wonder if there is ever an end with that sort of mentality. Especially in a point in our lives where we are so susceptible to change and are learning about different lifestyles through documentaries such as "Happy" it is pretty thought provoking to think about how people in different walks of life view such an abstract concept

   <br><br>

Additionally, I really liked the portion where they spoke on the chemical part of happiness and how dopamine is released. This does make me look at consumerism as almost like a dru that people are dependent on in order to fulfil some part of themselves. I do find it especially interesting that ther people outside of the US find happiness in very traditional values.
<br><hr>
I fully agree with you. Instead of believing the well-promoted lifestyle, people have to understand what happiness really means to them, and I feel like this movie serves as a good example of how people can be happy without pursuing or having the things that are luxury in most of the countries, but not here in the US. I feel like the world we live in right now is the outcome of the capitalist society that people have been working on since almost 4 centuries ago. Such obsession with money that came during this period of time was very misleading and in a way is the cause of most of the global problems we face today. Real happiness should be the feeling of being fulfilled as a person and not the image of a billionaire. This modern lifestyle, in my opinion, only leads us to loneliness and devastation. However, since the roots of capitalism are so ingrained in the system, it will be hard to guide it in the direction of improving people's happiness.
<br><hr>
I really like your comment and I believe what you said is exactly most people want to say. Besides, I really appreciate the definition of “happy” you provided in your comment. In this blundering society, it’s hard for us to reflect on ourselves and remind ourselves what kind of happiness we’re pursuing. When Ken provides the astonishing ranking of happiness and the corresponding climate footprints of the top-ranked countries, I caught the question of “what am I dreaming for?” The true happiness isn’t brought by buying new and luxury stuff endlessly, which is the extreme consumerism, but real happiness could be any meaningful part differs for individuals. Gaining fake happiness in the cost of the Earth is absolutely not tolerable.

<br><hr>
 I totally agree that we should take a step back and redefine what "happiness" really is and means to us. I think the culture in the US has created this idea that happiness is based off your material wealth, especially with the idea of the "American Dream." This creates a culture where overworking becomes normalized and material things are given more emphasis than meaningful connections with those around us. Moreover, this pursuit of happiness that so many people have pursued is arguably what has exacerbated fossil fuel emissions and brought us to the current state of the environment we have right now. I agree with you that we should start thinking about "what can I do that will make life more meaningful?" vs "how can i make more money and have more things?" It reminds of the part in the film where they introduce co-housing in Denmark. Those living in the house seemed really happy and satisfied with their lived because they had more time to themselves and they were able to create meaningful connections with the people they are living with. That was probably the scene that stood out to me the most because it made realize that instead of focusing on what we don't have, we should focus on what we can contribute to those around. I would say this also goes back to the fact that the US is a very individualistic culture where success of the individual is often given more emphasis the community. That being said, it would be a good idea to really try to analyze the way we define happiness and put some thought into how we can reimagine what we consider happiness.
<br><hr>
I share similar views about money and its supposed role in our happiness. The phrase "money can't buy happiness" is one I've always believed in. Like you mentioned, not having enough money to make ends meet definitely effects your happiness and mental state, but that still doesn't mean that having money is the answer to happiness. There are people who are rich or famous and miserable or have even killed themselves, so clearly wealth didn't absolve them of their problems. So, why should we let our definition of happiness be dictated by how much money we have, especially when we can be wealthy and still be unhappy? I really liked what you said about changing our mentalities from ones centered on money to ones focused on how to make life meaningful to us, because I feel like that is the true key to happiness, if there is one. Plus, it's better for the environment if we start to live by those standards instead.
<br><hr>
I really agree the points you’re making here. Ever since I have memory, I constantly hear people around me saying (directly saying or showing this opinion through actions or words) that money is good. Of course, you can’t do anything without any of it, but just as the old saying goes, money can’t buy everything. In fact, money can only buy a few things, and this is my major takeaway from this course. And it’s not only the American dream that engraining material pursuit and consumerism into people’s mind. China, where I come from and where the economy has been crazily rocketing for the past few decades, people are also every so crazy about purchasing houses as big as possible, luxuries, and anything related to financial gain. 

   <br><br>

I remember so clearly when I cried so bad for a younger cousin taking away my red envelope (the money you receive from your relatives during Spring Festival) when I was nine or so, my parents have been telling me that money isn’t everything. When I was bigger, they told me that there are many other ways to be happy other than making money. Therefore I think the ideology that the true happiness lies within your inner space instead of materialism comes very much from education. To me, for example, I feel happy when I get contact with nature, I feel happy listening to music, and I feel happy when I see others happy(I actually enjoyed watching the clips showing people’s happy face in the movie) 

   <br><br>

This movie emphasized this important life philosophy that happiness is found by yourself, but not given by something else.

<br><hr>
It is so inspiring that you checked the definition of what happiness is. People always have no satisfaction with what they have and desire more about what is unnecessary to them. I think the huge gap between the rich and the poor is also one of the reasons that people are wanting more. I remember back in high school when I read the great Gatsby, the way the American dream is described is having huge houses like what Gatsby does, holding parties, and being famous, just like Gatsby. Those kinds of “American Dream” have been unintentionally sticking to our minds, and that could lead us to what we have been doing and who we are right now. I feel like people are also so caught up in their lives, and care too much about following the trend and getting mad about what they do not have. If we find what happiness really is to ourselves, we will have our own healthy way of living instead of copying what is actually unnecessary for us.
<br><hr>
I agree with your entire comment. This film opened my eyes to the fact that America, as a  consumerist society, has made individuals feel as if they cannot live a satisfying life without an abundance of wealth. This causes people who primarily focus on obtaining money and materialistic things, to feel like they never have enough. In the film, places around the world were highlighted where people were content just living life, without worrying about constantly having more. These individuals seemed to be fulfilled in a way that consumerists are not. From now on, whenever I find myself getting caught up in materialistic things, I will remind myself that this is not where real happiness comes from. 
   <br><br>
On another note, Ken’s video was really compelling to move to another country. I’m sure Sweden and Denmark have their flaws just like the U.S, however, life seems so much more satisfying there. Not only are these countries more environmentally friendly, but their governments actually take care of their people. I understand why everyone is happier over there; the citizens of these countries know they have the right to healthcare and a higher education. It is crazy to me that in America, the majority of people are not getting put at top priority.

<br><hr>
I agree people focus on what will get them money because we have been taught that money will get us what we need and want. I am not going to say money cannot  bring you happiness because it can to a degree by allowing you to get the basic needs such as food, water,  a home and etc. Yet I will say happiness is not defined by money or success, but rather what satisfies a person what is meaning full to them, not having to do with materialistic things. I think the film does a great job in looking at various ways in which happiness is perceived globally and what universal aspects seem to correlate with happiness such as personal growth, meaningful relationships with other, the idea of flow and etc.
<br><hr>
Watching the film, I had similar opinions that developed as the ones you’ve commented. What defines someone as happy is definitely a cultural thing. I used to live in Japan, and I remember traveling to the richer areas where everyone had a huge house and the latest car model, phone, clothes, etc. but there were also parts of Japan that were leaning more in touch with nature. I could really tell it was a more simplistic lifestyle and people seemed happy. The difference I believe was that the richer parts of Japan adopted an aspect of American culture which was very materialistic. Comparing what I have seen in Japan and here in America. America is extremely materialistic. Happiness is based off of your income and if you can buy the latest model of car, clothes, iphone, and the bigger something was, the better--such as your house. I also believe that someone who might not have these things in America, can be very unhappy. We are constantly surrounded with TV shows, movies, ads in magazines or posters on the walls, of people having these nice materialistic things. We compare to someone else and I think that is why happiness is unattainable here. Someone will always have something better than you therefore leaving someone in an unending chase towards happiness.
   <br><br>


I also used to live in Germany and would often travel (usually by car and not by plane) to other surrounding countries. I noticed the Nordic/Scandinavian countries had some of the most simplistic lifestyles, and interestingly, I also found out that the Nordic/Scandinavian countries scored the highest on an index measuring happiness (hopefully I can find the source to this later). Instead of chasing after more and more things that are almost unattainable, the more simple lifestyle seems to be set up for more happiness--you don’t need much and you appreciate what you already have.
   <br><br>
A person’s mindset is heavily impacted by their cultural norms. The norm in the US is pretty much “bigger is better” whereas in other countries, it could all be about appreciating what you have and not needing a lot.


<br><hr>

My favorite part of this film was also seeing the happiness found in other countries across the world. Throughout the various cultures shown, there were always some very stark differences between those cultures and ours. One very obvious one would be technology. When the film visited cultures in Japan and Kolkata, there was not a phone in sight. There were no ringers going off, no advertisements being shoved down their throats, and no drama over who didn’t get tagged in somebody’s Instagram post. I hate to say that technology is an inconvenience or a burden, because it really has revolutionized the lifestyle of most of the world. It is safe to admit, though, that technology creates its own toxicities. Seeing the happiness of those living simpler lifestyles than we do in America makes me wonder if we’d be better off with the same values of those cultures. 

   <br><br>

Like you said, it’s important for everyone to think of their own definitions of happiness. One part of the film that resonated with me was when they discussed the fact that helping other people has shown to increase happiness. I think helping other people is a large part of my definition of happiness. Spreading positivity, whether that be doing actual charity work or simply sharing good feelings with others, allows you to know you’re spreading the same happiness you’re feeling yourself. Personally, that amplifies my happiness even more. It’s not that fun to be happy by yourself, in my opinion; if I can do anything to lift my friends up when they need it, it allows me to have a much better time experiencing my happiness knowing they’re experiencing happiness too.
<br><hr>

After watching Happy, I too have come to question the basis of my happiness and the values that have been instilled in me from living in this country all my life. Although I logically know from experience and observation that material wealth is not the key to happiness, I still cannot help trying to chase the American definition of success. This intrinsic desire to attain materialistic success and fulfill the American Dream is too ingrained within me and extremely difficult to fight off. Watching this movie helped me reevaluate my life, but it is still very difficult for me to change it. I think this is also similar to why it is so difficult to act on the climate crisis. Although I logically know how detrimental certain actions of mine are towards the planet, it is still hard for me to change it. I hope I can work through these futures in the issue and attain happiness while fighting against the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
This film talks about the happiness portion of today's human life. What it really takes to be happy? Is it money, status, fame or something else? We should put a smile on our face and stop for a second so that we can get a greater perspective on what exactly this life is all about. And I totally agree with your point on redefining the happiness. What does happiness mean to us? 89% Interesting points about what can lead to a person's true happiness in conducting a long lasting healthy life, even in ways I never knew to be possible. But hey, who doesn't have a preference in life?

<br><hr>
I can really relate to what you said in your comment Catherine. Even outside of this class, I have been looking for what I can do to make my life more meaningful to me rather than what I can do to make the most money or have the most things. However, this class and the climate crisis, as a whole, showed me the benefits of this lifestyle. Our generation has been mostly raised on the belief that in order to become "successful," you need to be rich and therefore own a big house and a nice car and have lots of things. This definition of success is so arbitrary. Its actually so ridiculously angering that somewhere along the line in history, humans felt the need to define success by material wealth.

   <br><br>

This class has pushed me into somewhat of an existential crisis, in fear of how little my actions truly mean on a global scale. However, this film gave me a lot of hope, and happiness. In that, my actions don't need to be actions of global proportions. If I remove the value in many of the meaningless evaluations of material possessions and live my life with the goal of just being happy, I know that I will be doing good for both the world and for myself. This film really did wonders for my mentality and my hope for a good life and, hopefully, a good planet.
<br><hr>

Great comment. By telling stories and values of people outside US, the film addresses that happiness doesn’t have to be materialistic. The idea that less money can also lead to happiness is what we needed for US citizens today. As Ken has mentioned that living in a big house or owing a luxury car represents wealth in American culture, hence they will pursue those things as much as they can, resulting in increase in their climate footprints. We should learn from the film to be happy without a lot of money. Everyone can through pursue happiness through consumption, but not everyone can gain happiness in poverty. Even though this film doesn’t directly talk about climate crisis, it indicates people to switch their lifestyles to a more sustainable way that they can stop buying cars, traveling in flight, living in big houses, and buying unnecessary goods.

Your comment summed up everything I got from this film. I hate that we as Americans define happiness as materialistic wealth, and even though I hate it and I am aware of it, I still fell into the materialistic mindset trap; I have everything I need and more, yet I still want more. When I watched this film and saw how people with less materialistic items than me be happy, it made me even more aware that happiness is not dependent on materialistic wealth. We Americans grew up with the concept that in order to be happy, we need to be financially successful; this is a toxic way of thinking, and we will never be truly happy if we continue to think this way. I am trying to change my definition of happiness into something that is not materialistic wealth, but it is hard when our society continues to push the idea of materialistic wealth equating into happiness. If we were to get rid of this mindset, I feel like there would be in general less depressed people in America.

I completely agree - the realization that you can live your life in pursuit of happiness directly, rather than in pursuit of money as a means to supposed happiness, is so simple but felt so earth-shattering to me. Particularly eye-opening to me within the film Happy was the focus on Bhutan’s system of Gross National Happiness. The fact that (using the film’s own example) the country would forgo economic gain brought by flooding the valleys so that their people’s culture, wellbeing and happiness would be preserved absolutely mind-boggled me. America would absolutely never make that choice, because we assume, foolishly, that more money equals more happiness, yet we let many people die, and countless more suffer, in order to pursue economic gain. No wonder we rank as the 19th-happiest country.
    <br><br>
Even more sad than our own situation, however, seems the situation in Japan, where working one’s self to death is so common that it has a name: karoshi. As someone removed from that culture and way of life, it’s easy to think “How could they possibly be willing to work that hard and ignore the consequences? Why don’t they change their way of life?” Meanwhile, people in the happiest countries on earth like Norway are probably looking at the American work culture and thinking the exact same thing. 
    <br><br>
One thing I liked about Happy was the film's emphasis on the fact that the tools to happiness are completely free. If, after examining your own life, you find that your priorities have been in the wrong place in terms of seeking happiness, it’s never too late to change those priorities. Participating in a community, giving back, recreation, and self-growth are completely free, and always possible.

I did not expect this class to take such a pleasant turn. It’s nice to be reminded that happiness is not this mythical creature that rarely shows itself, it is attainable if we look for it in the right places (However, it can be difficult to attain due to other out of control issues-mental health). Not in money, in that new car, those shoes, that perfume, but in ourselves, others, and the world around us. Thus, we need to take care of our mind and body, the well being of others, and the health of our earth.  Especially as young adults in college, we are experiencing so many new experiences, topics, and learning material that we don’t all have the answers to deal and cope with them. It can be difficult to navigate such space. For example, no one is really prepared to learn all the shit and destruction we’ve caused to the planet, others, and ourselves. Everyday you learn more and more about the fucked up things we do and it does take a toll on our emotional mental state. I just feel, as college students we get so caught up with classes and our social lives we forget to make sure we are truly okay and truly happy with what we do. Please y'all, let’s be nicer to ourselves, you all are enough, you all can be happy too (Let’s not forget that sadness and the emotions that don’t feel so great are normal too and play a huge part in your mental well being, it’s okay to feel other things besides happiness- it becomes an issue when the “sad” emotions are felt more frequent and affect lifestyles.)

This documentary is similar to the minimalist in the sense that one can find happiness outside the materialistic world but this one takes a human condition approach to the concept of happiness. And the message also hits differently when you're told to be happy with the things you have from the economically stable white majority compared to anyone else. Seeing our society from the outside, looking at other countries and how mental health is a priority over wealth I firmly believe we’ve been conditioned to believe happiness is money well spent. It begs the question, does money make you happier? The typical answer is yes because people would rather be crying in a nice car than the latter. However, it does not defeat the fact that you're still crying right? You’re still suffering internally right?

It's so strange to think about how we were raised in a society that puts so much emphasis on material goods. I understand some people's desire to buy new items and such but the way people love to flex on brand names and designer brands in order to signify wealth has always seemed so pretentious to me. As someone who has visited many other nations in the world (obviously, before knowing the extent of issues air travel causes us), I was so astonished by how vastly different societal norms are. In my visit to Costa Rica  for example, many people seemed to love their modest lifestyles without having to worry about the concept of wealth. I am not saying, however, that people cannot lavish in their own wealth. I understand, if someone has made a fortune, they have their own right to spend that money the way they truly want to. However, there are people I have met that go out of their way to buy designer brands who clearly can't afford them. I just think to myself "Is there really any point?" Anyways, this film definitely reassured my view point on things and how our society should switch how they view our materialistic society.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. The American Dream has been distorted in consumerism and materialism. People try to achieve an illusion that could never become real because they always want more. Most of us definitely have a comfortable life to live on. But we decide to make a better future no matter what it takes. As long as we end up being wealthy and successful, we are happy. However, is that what we are born for? Are we suppose to enslaved by money and power? I think money can buy "quick happiness”, tricks your mind to become high as drugs do. The real happiness has to be found within ourselves. It is more of a mental rather than a material thing. I really liked the meditation idea mentioned by Ken. It makes sense that you can concentrate on your goal when you calm down.

<br><hr>
I agree with you in the fact that we have strayed from what actually has the potential to make us happy and create new values that we can align with in order to create a better future and planet. I really appreciate that Ken included this film even though it does not directly have to do with climate change. I think by doing this we must redefine what is considered the "American Dream". It is selfish for us to continue consuming exponentially after our basic needs are met while there are other who are not as fortunate that struggle to even meet the baseline. We are told that if we had a little more money, we had more articles of clothing, or continued updating our appliances we will reach a the destination of happiness. With this level of consumerism we have lost the idea that happiness is a feeling and have established the principle that happiness has a correlation with monetary gain.
      <br><br>

I think it is interesting when we are exposed in the film that the experiences one takes part in life has a greater influence on someone's overall happiness in opposition to an object. The examples of exercise, spending time with loved ones, and practicing a lifestyle of mindfulness will set us free. As Ken mentions it would be one thing if were releasing the large amount of carbon emissions if it was for the greater good of humanity rather than our own selfish endeavours.

I agree with the notion that a sense of happiness is unique to each person.  I found it fascinating to hear in the film, “Happy” that the average American is no happier than the average citizen in what would be considered a “3rd-world country.”  Watching this enlightening film brought me to the conclusion that expensive items and superficial lifestyle highlighted in American culture are all things unnecessary to be a happy individual.  You don’t need money to be happy.  I think it’s about finding your “flow”; it’s the things that you choose to do everyday and make time for are what contribute to you being happy, and of course a strong support system.  I thought the message of this film was very inspiring and well-fitted towards the end of this course.  Almost as an uplifting note to live a happy & conscious lifestyle for yourself.

<br><hr>
After watching the film "Happy" I was surprised to see that most of the people that are considered to be happier than others, live lifestyles that are shunned by the people that only desire wealth and fame. It's nice to know that true happiness doesn't come from your material possessions, but from the way you live your life and the people you surround yourself with. I really liked the quote, "try to work so you'll be able to live your life in tranquility", it lowkey makes me want to stop being a bio major and just go with the flow. I don't need all this extra stress especially when I'm basically failing my classes. I came into UCSB wanting to be a doctor just so that I can get paid handsomely and live a lavish lifestyle, however I already find myself a part of that hedonic treadmill where I'm always unsatisfied and wanting more. I basically have to give up my social life to study for these classes that almost seem impossible to study for and it is taking a detrimental effect on my well-being. I already know I'm not going to change this though because I've been thinking about this since I was a little kid and I'd be lost if I just change gears and take a different path. Instead I'm going to be focusing more on intrinsic goals rather than extrinsic, whether that is to personally grow as a person, build lasting relationships and getting that desire to help others. I feel that caring for the environment and actually being aware that the climate is changing really helps make a person more happy because once you have your basic needs met, more money won't buy you happiness.
<br><hr>
I also really loved how the film showed that there are many people out there around the world living in poorer circumstances than the average American and still manage to be happy. This of course does show that money and things aren’t really needed to be happy, but I don’t think it makes them completely unnecessary. I still believe you need to be financially well to be happy, especially in a country like this, in which you need money to buy important things. Unfortunately, many are caught in this lifestyle of chasing money and things, but you can’t really blame them for wanting a taste of something that seems so amazing, even though it isn’t. 
       <br><br>
 I completely agree that we should all reflect upon our definition of success because everyone has different definitions. There are many that include wealth and success in their definition of happiness, and I would be lying if I said I wasn’t one of them. Unfortunately, I was pretty much born into this “trap”. My family has never really been wealthy, so I was raised with the need of more money always being there. This has caused me to set my sights on this chase of money in order to not live this life that I have been living. Basically, I am saying we all have our reasons for the way we define words.


<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading your comment, it reminded me of why I'm passionate about environmental change and why I pursue to tell my friends what I believe in. At first, I was unsure of why I was even trying to make a change in my lifestyle to reduce climate change if many other people didn't and I thought one person isn't going to make a difference. However, I was completely wrong one person can make the difference between many others and not only that but you find yourself doing more meaningful actions in your life that lead to satisfaction and happiness within yourself. Like you mentioned many people might have the wrong definition of happiness and many Americans indeed are blinded to what happiness is because they believe in the American dream and nothing else. Many keep on wanting more and more in their life that they are just never satisfied or consent with what they have because they want to achieve the American dream that is sometimes just not ideal. I agree with all your points stated and I believe many people do prioritize materialistic things thinking it will make them happy but in turn, only leads them feeling temporary fulfillment and once they get over it they go back to wanting more and more stuff. It's an ongoing cycle for them and they never truly feel what happiness really is about until they find things they enjoy doing and that are good for their mind and soul that bring meaning to their life.
<br><hr>
I really loved how the filmed showed different ways people lived their lives around the world as well. I’ve had experience with other cultures as I’ve lived with in other countries and have come to known a lot of their customs and it’s such a contrast to the United Stated. I think one the things that doesn’t get emphasized enough was the work hours. In the United States we get worked to death. We come home tired front the long hours only to come back home to go to sleep and repeat the cycle the next day. In other countries like ken mentions this isn’t what happens. The Nordic countries get so much time off and work a lot less so they really get to have a lot of free time. In the countries that I lived in the people used this free time to really build strong relationships with their families and friends. They really got to know themselves are their environment and it ultimately made the people a lot happier. I agree we need to rethink what happiness means to us. The way happiness is defined in our country just doesn’t work for everyone. The unchecked capitalist society that touts rugged individualism for the poor is a sham. If the definition of happiness is wealth then not everyone can be happy because every single person in this country can’t be wealthy. We need to reshape the culture in America or else we’ll we trapped in our pursuit of happiness
<br><hr>
I love this! You hit on so many great points. We live in a consumerist culture that has taught us to endlessly chase after material gains to achieve this sense of satisfaction that we have wrongfully labeled as "happiness". Even if we did not create this culture, we are complicit in it by continuing to participate in the facade despite knowing the truth. Ultimately, we know that material things do not make us happy. So if chasing these things doesn't really make us happy, why are we so willing to participate in this capitalistic cycle of exploitation? I think we do need to give ourselves a reality check and start thinking about what is really important. We also need to really grasp the effect our consumerist lifestyles have on others and on the planet. Once we give ourselves this reality check, we can hopefully foster a greater sense of empathy and compassion so that we can be more motivated to adopt sustainable practices.
<br><hr>
Amazing comment! I could not agree more! We are conditioned to think that happiness means having a family, a big house, a nice car, and a ton of material goods. For many of us this dream life isn't even our dream, but rather the one that society created for us to have. I agree with you that some amount of financial stability is required, but at the same time, if people chose to leave in smaller houses and buy less things, they could follow their dreams, even if their dreams don't necessarily mean making a ton of money. I also believe that people becoming more altruistic with their career choices will lead to happier people. Rather than asking yourself what job would make me the most money as yourself what job would allow me to use my special talents to  be the most at service to the world?

<br><hr>
Upfront, I would like to acknowledge that meditation is not for everyone, and a lot of the concepts and proposals for increased happiness may seem weird. However, your dictionary quotation shows the truth about happiness. As you note, there is a financial threshold at which money no longer correlates with your happiness. I have a good friend who often claims that making money is the best way to achieve happiness, and we have debated the subject for years. While I simply want to meet that threshold, and would rather make a difference in the world than acquire gross wealth, he believes that money augments your happiness in life, in any volume.

       <br><br>

Thus far in his life, he has been the poster child for the american dream,  and even his status as a university student happened despite all odds. Moreover, he feels that he must complete the cycle by achieving the american dream and he will refuse to quit until he makes lots of money. However, he is environmentally conscious, and thus, after watching all of these videos I think it likely that he will see the dangers to the environment resulting from consumerism and capitalism. 

       <br><br>

I think his situation can really apply to a lot of people, just because, if this information were widely spread, many people would discover that the link between happiness and wealth is not concrete. That is one of the many reasons why I think the availability of this class is crucial to delivering the titular message enshrined in one of Ken''s other videos: Being the Change.

<br><hr>
I enjoyed this comment a lot, and I also agree with you. I wanted to touch on materialism and greed a little bit. Some of my comments while in this class have touched on human greed and selfishness. I don't think these things are individual problems, but instead problems that our society has conditioned us into following and identifying with. 
       <br><br>
For example, most people do not want to go vegan because they love the taste of animal products so much. They think humans are entitled to the finer things in life, like the pleasure of taste. Us humans love pleasure. Anything that benefits us, anything that feels good, we can become addicted to and dependent on. In this case, humans are saying their own pleasure is more important than the well-being of our planet and the lives of other animals.
       <br><br>
We are addicted to pleasure, and maybe the small splash of dopamine that comes with those things that provide us that pleasure. We are all addicted to something-- I'm sure my body is dependent on the prescribed medication I take to regulate my dopamine.
       <br><br>
How can we make life more meaningful?
       <br><br>
Give back. Give back to other humans, give back to animals, give back to OUR PLANET.
<br><hr>

 this film also made me reflect more on what happiness is. Thank you for sharing the definition of happiness because I did not know a definition it had was the will to do something. I guess in that sense, happiness could be the will to be more environmentally friendly. I liked how this film taught us that trying to seek happiness through materialism is not the solution at all. Thank you for the encouragement to reflect on our own definition of happiness. To be honest, I never really thought of that. There's so many different perspectives to what happiness is and I need to slowly see how I could be happy without trying to achieve the American Dream.
<br><hr>
This documentary was quite an eye-opener for me as well. It's so sad to see that most people spend their entire life chasing something that isn't there. Happiness clearly cannot be found in material goods, so why are we so focused on it? We waste so much time trying to achieve these goals instead of trying to find what really makes us happy. Life should have more meaning than cars and houses and clothes. The media tries to convince us that those are the only things that matter and most of the time we fall for it. We need to teach the younger generation how to find a deeper meaning in life and to show them that happiness comes from within, not from our financial status or the size of our house. Growing up seeing my parents stress about money has made me really motivated to become financially successful, but now I'm beginning to rethink my whole mindset. I think I would be better off doing something I actually enjoy than sitting in a cubicle till I die.

<br><hr>
I’m embarrassed. A minute ago I used my lululemon and bikini obsession as obstacles that stop me from buying less because I am proud of saving up for things I want and then enjoying them. This film really brought to light a lot of issues that the American public needs to face. I get it because I’m one of them--but our obsession with STUFF! If you don’t have xyz there’s something “wrong” with you. At the end of the day I know that what matters most to me are not materialistic items. Instead they are literal people and experiences I treasure: my family, and close friends, and scuba diving/ having incredible memories with people I love. The issue is that I don’t always remember that that’s all I need to be happy. I’m flooded with social media feeds that make me feel insufficient in some way so I try to fill those gaps with stuff! I feel like other countries and the examples in the film of those who are just happy with less don’t face as many of these issues (social media and social pressure). This is not an excuse for us but something to consider when comparing the two populations objectively is a bit unfair. Ken talks about the Swedish work 6 hours a week only 5 hours a day and they are some of the happiest on the planet because they have time for the people and experiences that matter to them. Maybe that is the issue--we work too much and to alleviate that stress we buy and buy and are less happy. Either way I am interested to see how this develops and if we will ever retire from being unhappy workaholics.

In seventh grade I did a project on the concept of happiness. I asked people outside of Trader Joes what made them happy and filmed their responses to include in a final video. Doing things that make you happy is such an important part of being a human being. This is why I was thrilled that this documentary, “Happy,” was included in the course. Tying our well-being into taking action against the climate crisis is crucial, and they tie together so well. The film mentions how acts of kindness and worrying about the well-being of our world as well as our own can make us happier. So, living in an environmentally friendly manner and doing things encouraged in this course can not only positively impact our planet but it can directly increase our personal happiness. One woman in the documentary describes how wonderful co-housing is, and how it saved her from isolation after her divorce. The members of these communities are supportive of one another in many ways. Sharing amenities also means sharing the workload and spending time with other families. These things also mean more affordable, climate conscious housing. 
       <br><br>

I completely agree with what you said about the foreign lifestyles featured in this film contrasting the American dream. You’re right that American culture has paired materialistic gain with the pursuit of happiness, but what we saw in the movie proves you can be happy with a little amount of stuff. I do like that Ken acknowledges that a certain income might be required for a certain level of comfort, but our happiness is not dependent on money after a certain point. I love that you included how each and every one of us should reflect on our own definition of happiness and find a separation between that and success. You’re right that at some point chasing money is not productive, but rather taking a beat to ask yourself what is meaningful to you will result in a more fulfilling life. 
       <br><br>

I also liked the idea that the government is responsible for creating an environment where citizens can pursue happiness. Taking small personal actions are important, and I hope to take more to increase my own happiness, but it starts at the top. The culture in a country needs to be adjusted to decrease the emphasis on work and increase the support for health and happier living.

<br><hr>
First of all, I completely agree with you when you said we can never find real happiness if all we focus on and care about is material gain. In the film, Dr. Sonja stated that even though “50 percent of our happiness level is determined by our genes, the other 10% is determined by our circumstances (income, social status, etc.) and another 40% by the things you choose to do.” The problem with today’s beliefs is that many of us choose 10% over 40%, we choose to have a gilded appearance than a truly happy heart. It is not surprising to learn that wealth doesn’t make people happier, in fact, wealthy people often are more stressed and have less freedom than those who aren’t.  
       <br><br>


I also questioned what the American Dream had become in recent years. From what I learned in history class, American Dream used to be an idea that people are given equal opportunities to chase after their dream (whether it is for better education or higher standard of living). However, it seems to be just a strategy for companies to earn money by brainwashing people via tv commercials and video ads that bomb us everywhere, every day. The truth is, our life isn’t getting better when we own an extra pair of shoes or a piece of expensive clothing. We might get temporarily excited, but in the end, we are not getting happier, we just own another piece of useless stuff.

<br><hr>
I love your comment and totally agree with it. This film has completely shifted my long-time hold belief that happiness is related to material fulfillments. The society we are living in now has a totally twisted ideology of consumerism. The medias, the celebrities, the influencers, there are so many people trying to convince us we can buy happiness through money. We can be satisfied simply through buying stuff. 
       <br><br>
The movie expresses a clear "NO" to all the above ideologies. I enjoy every moment of watching it and rethinking my sources of happiness in mind. This movie expresses that it's not how many things we possess matter. However, it's our inner selves that matter. I see different people gaining happiness through closely feeling the natural world, helping others with their own power, building up communities with families and friends, going through personal traumas and regaining inner peace...Those things touch me deeply, and they inspire me to think the things in my life that I'm grateful for. Suddenly I realized I have so many sources to inspire me, to bring me happiness, to bring our the shining pieces inside of me, and none of them is related to things I previously thought that held importance, such as money, social status, good looking...In contrary, they were family, friends, music, movies, nature, food, animals, and etc. 
       <br><br>
"Happy" itself is never based on consumption. We each individual should keep that in mind, and to find our genuine goals and directions.

<br><hr>
I agree it was very interesting to see that other countries seem to find more happiness in a less consumerist society and as a result are also not impacting negatively our envirnoment. Yeah it is sad taht our society has been made to value materialsitic things and we are told that having all these materialsitic things will make us happy. The film was so interesting sinec it explored happiness from various places and the happinest places seemed to be where the people had the least, it reminded me of the idea of minimalism.
<br><hr>
I too found the film “Happy” incredibly enlightening on how some of our cultural assumptions about happiness often exist in complete contrast to the scientifically proven methods to improve our happiness and satisfaction with life. Happiness is less tied to our financial and materialistic success than our compassion and connection with the people closest to us. This is clearly demonstrated in the film by the families and communities that might not be as affluent or comfortable as the average american family, but report much more fulfillment and content with the lives they live. When watching this film my initial reaction to the homes and poverty these people lived in was one of pity, but by the end of the film I felt something more akin to envy for how cheerful and compassionate they were.
       <br><br>
It's really quite ironic that in a country where the pursuit of happiness is a constitutional right, the happiness of the average American has not improved over the last century. Despite all of our vast technological and scientific innovations, and our incredibly improved understanding of ourselves and our universe, people are no happier than they were decades ago. Our homes are bigger, our paychecks larger, and our worries are diminished, but why aren’t we happier? This is the question I imagine many are asking themselves. This is because our cultural expectations for happiness are not reality.
       <br><br>
Considering the potential environmental benefits of pursuing happiness in this more realistic way, makes it even more persuasive. It’s our consumption in pursuit of happiness that has caused our planet so much damage, turning away from this pursuit in favor of more fulfilling alternatives could do a great deal of good for us and for our planet.

<br><hr>
I find that the main issue with happiness in America is that people tend to just overlook it. It's so easy to set your mind on something like wealth because it feels more real. You can imagine how that extra money will feel. You can imagine having that new car, or that new iPhone, or whatever it may be. Happiness on the other hand is much more abstract for people. They look at it as something that comes and goes. They don't look at it as something that could actively improve on. If people were to face the concept of happiness more often, such as by meditating, or by writing down what you are thankful for, or anything of that manner, they will actually be much happier in the end.
       <br><br>

The things that make us happy are different for everyone. For some it may be people, such as the family living in co-housing in Denmark. For some it may be surfing, like the guy that lived in Costa Rica. For some it may be having someone close that loves you, such as the woman who suffered through the truck accident. For some it may be taking care of others, like the man at the end of the film. Everyone is different and people must face the idea of happiness in order to find what works for themselves. While money may provide happiness (although typically only until basic needs are met), the road to this wealth often won't include the things needed to make one happy. This is what I believe causes dissatisfaction and unhappiness in America and across the world. Doing what makes us happy now should be more of a concern than grinding for money in hopes of living a "happier" life, after we have already wasted away half of our lives.
<br><hr>
I agree that in America we have a very materialistic culture and there is huge pressure, especially among the youths, to keep up with the best of the best items in order to be “happy.” I see this affecting everyone in the US and other developed nations especially. In a pursuit of happiness, society is destroying our every surrounding. We continue to want bigger and better as “Happy” says in order to live the perfect lives. However, we’re only getting more and more dissatisfied with our lives, and yet we still think having tons of new things will improve our quality of life. I was always told as a kid that money can’t buy you happiness, and I agree with that point. Even though we gain instant gratification from buying stuff, most of that stuff goes to waste, and inevitably hurts the environment from first to last in a product’s lifetime. I enjoyed this film, and I believe this could really change people’s mindsets about their materialistic tendencies. Life isn’t about the things you have, and people should be taught that, because their quality of life would go up if they started to see the beauty in nature, their surroundings, and the people in their lives. I would recommend this film to others to inspire them to live less materialistic lifestyles.
<br><hr>
This was an extremely well put together comment. I also agree that we need to reflect on what defines our happiness. The film happy addressed a society which was cultivated to consume and produce. We as americans have been the frontline of the idealistic lifestyle which has contributed to a large part of greenhouse gas emissions. Our lifestyle has been driven by an ever growing desire for more and more things. And like you said we attribute or happiness to our marital success. If we took the approach of those in the documentary then maybe we could let go of our material attachments and be happy with less. This documentary made me really think of what's important in life. If we have all of our basic needs set the only other thing that we need to focus on is our own happiness. You have to really ask yourself whether your doing the right things for your happiness.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you that in the American lifestyle people are often consuming as a misguided pursuit of happiness and destroying the planet on the way. As you said, we will never find happiness by filling our wants through materialistic items and this film completely shows that this is not the case. This film shows real people who are genuinely happy without having money or things but because they are content with their life or situation they are in. Another interesting factor in this film that caught my attention was how the film started off with the basis of the psychology of happiness and how it affects your health. It is so interesting to see that 50% of happiness is set on a person’s genes, 10% from circumstances and 40% from intellectual activity. This being said, happiness does not depend on consuming or materialistic items. Instead, I agree with you that many people need to reflect upon our definition of happiness and see what truly matters in the world.
<br><hr>
I feel that one of the big flaws about the American Dream being the best that one can strive for is that there is no real end to it. Why stop once you have a 5000 sq. ft. home? Why stop when you have five cars? There are always new and better things coming out. These new products aren't things we need to have but they're marketed in a way where we want the new best thing and the chase for the next thing probably defines happiness for a lot of people and this shows in how Americans buy so much stuff but keep buying stuff year after year, throwing away the old stuff for the new. Materialism can never had an end goal because companies do not profit from it. The culture that has been created means that we are basically never satisfied if materialism is the thing we use to define happiness. In order to combat this, happiness should come from the experiences that we go through and the things that are around us. They don't need to be tangible things and they don't need to be things that affects the environment. We do not need millions of dollars to live comfortably. Once our basic needs are met, there really is no point to go bigger as it makes us fall into that cycle of buying the next big thing.

I agree with you. Even though the US is one of the wealthest countries in the world, it is still far from the happiest; according to research, people with wealth are often less happy than their gardeners. To make this movue, the director went to many countries and interviewed people with different family backgrounds. This movie made me realize that besides money, there are many other things can also make people happy. Something I think is more important than money is interpersonal relationship. Unlike normals, many rich people need to worry about their personal information and their security, so they have to keep distance with individuals they meet. They live on high hills alone, most of the time they have no one can talk to. Similarily, parents work for long hours with their children stay at home alone. They think they provided their children with material wealth is the greatest thing in the family, but that's not their children want. As a child, he/she wants parents accompany- times spent together making memories. I know this is impossible for Americans to change their work styles, but I do hope individuals could spent more time with their families.

I like your definition of happiness. I couldn't agree more that it's important to think about how we personally define happiness, and how it compares to what society considers to be the source of it. The third definition of "willing to do something" really struck me and related to the part of the film that was about reward. "We all need something bigger than ourselves to care about," said one respondent. "I believe that transcendental thinking is a necessary condition for happiness, which the American dream does not allow. The American dream keeps us in a box, preventing us from making deep connections with people, but an unhealthy connection with money and material things. Another line in the movie is: "our society tells us that the way to be a capable person, to be a good person, is to make a lot of money." This mindset further fuels capitalism and the destructive fossil fuel industry on which we depend. The movie inspired the idea that we can't be selfish and we should find time to focus on working for the happiness of others and the world. This mindset is important in tackling climate change. As we work toward this goal and make decisions every day, we can boost our happiness by being aware of things that are more important than ourselves.

Hello, I agree with everything that you said. It is so ironic that we continue to be not happy enough even though we are so focused on our material possessions and we have many things that we wanted before. I believe that we must focus on our surroundings and learn how to give back to our planet. IF we don't then our environment will suffer even more in the future. I'm glad that your epiphany is very similar to mine. I hope the world learns how to become happy for not only themselves but also for everyone around them in this same planet.
<br><hr>
I like how much of an emphasis you put on being truly happy in life, not worrying too much about material things even if you aren't the wealthiest. It is so easy to get caught up in a lifestyle where money is what you always want, and you always spend it on new shoes or save up for a new care, etc. I used to kind of look at life like this, where I just really wanted a lot of money in the future so I could buy as many things as I wanted. However, I'm starting to shift towards a different kind of happy. I'm getting satisfied by non-material things and appreciating everything about life. 
        <br><br>

This film showed me how materialistic America actually is and how misguided so many of us as Americans are.
<br><hr>
I also got a lot out of Happy. It is the best one to use to reflect on your own life in my opinion. The American Dream is thought to be that success, money, big and better everything will make us happy, but that is not the case. Happiness comes from other things. Ken talks about the correlation between high amounts of carbon emissions and low amounts of happiness. While this wasn’t the point of the film, I think the correlation is very important to the course. 
        <br><br>

There is enough overlap between the happiest countries that the reasons why people are happy is pretty evident. These countries are more collective culturally. The U.S has an individualistic culture. There is a larger number of vacation days that people get and universal health care in these happier countries, showing that people care about their communities over themselves. 
        <br><br>

I like the part of the film that talks about how money can only buy so much happiness. There is almost a cap on it; money buys happiness until you have everything you need to be stable. After that, it just becomes a burden, just as much as too little money is a burden. Through this entire course, I have learned more about how to have a fulfilling, happy life. My quality of life is determined by what I do with it, rather than what most people see as the American Dream. After watching this film the first time, I decided to do more of what I enjoy doing and find a balance between my responsibilities and my desires.
<br><hr>
I really enjoyed your comment and I agree with you. I think after watching the film "Happy" I had to take a step back and think of what happiness was to me. My parents weren't able to pursue higher education, so I am the first person in my family attending college. For me, going to college has always been for my future job. My parents want me to be more "successful" than they were, which ultimately means making more money. When I think of what my parents have, I know it isn't a lot but I also know they are happy. So why do we equate money and things with happiness? I think our society had tricked us into thinking that big homes, nice cars, and fancy clothes correlate to happiness but after thinking about it, happiness is more about family for me.
<br><hr>
So many people when confronted with the option to change their lives to greener habits are scared. They are scared that they won't be able to do the things they like to do, that their family will suffer, or that they will no longer live normal lives. When I talk to my friends about our futures so many of us say we don't want a "normal" suburban life. But what are really against? As Americans we are fortunate (many of us) to be able to CHOOSE to give up a comfortable easy life and live a life that is more fair to each other and the planet. Young people feel trapped by society to follow the paths that consumerism wants them to. As Catherine puts it "unlimited consumerism, owning a bigger house and luxury vehicles." That's such an intense amount of pressure! Have we ever thought about that? I haven't! That our view of success is colored by how much we own,  on a scale of nothing to LITERALLY everything. How can we even think of comparing our success the success of billionaires!  Why shouldn't success be based around our happiness? Why shouldn't we settle? A boring life filled with a soul sucking job and waste and cookie cutter houses? This documentary shows a different and better view of normal. A view where I can have a family and neighborhood that isn't based around work or money but mutually beneficial arrangements and community. A life that interacts with nature and people and a life that you can live without guilt? A busy life full of work and happiness and tasks that you can do with your own hands and provide for yourself? That sounds unattainably good. It is far more hopeful than I have looked  into my future and saw. And it made me really really want it. And it's attainable! That's the crazy thing! We can chose any path we want and make our happiness from it! So why are we still following the paths that people who don't really care. about us played out freaking decades ago?
<br><hr>
I find it really interesting that the definition of happiness is all about satisfaction. I think oftentimes satisfied is used as synonymous with content, but both are usually put lower on the totem pole than happiness. A lot of people when asked whether or not they are content with life will say yes but they aren't happy, and I feel like that stems out of this American lifestyle and these ideals that they have been force-fed since they were little. Since we are taught that happiness looks a certain way, we think that being content does not mean we are happy, it means that we are satisfied with where we are but that does not equal happiness because it doesn't look like this picture of happiness that we know. And because of this, we trap ourselves in a never ending chase for this picture perfect American life and that chase makes us neither happy nor content. It really is a terrible trap that people have been put in, and it's especially sad because most don't even realize. I can only hope that one day in life I will be extremely content, and I will have learned enough that I can realize it's a state of happiness.
<br><hr>
I also really enjoyed how the film featured different aspects of the lives of people across the globe. From a young age, Americans are taught that earning a lot of money and owning a lot of material goods is the most common indicator of happiness. I think many kids often go through a phase of being in awe of their peers who owned the newest games, had the most toys, etc. It is obvious that this mindset is often carried into adulthood, with people who earn large incomes often getting praise for their success and wealth. However, after watching this video I realize that we often do not base success on things that seem to be the most important. For example, many countries often focus on building an individual's own work ethic, self-worth, and relationships to friends and family to develop happiness. As a capitalist society, I believe Americans should do more to focus on living in the now and appreciating people around us. While material wealth can bring temporary happiness, wealth cannot always be the source of happiness if a person does not have a strong sense of self or role within their family or community. 
        <br><br>
I agree with your statement and I also believe that people should take a step back and re-evaluate what they consider the most important factors related to their happiness. I think its important for us as young people to begin considering these factors now to determine what to look for in terms of careers, relationships etc. This movie has inspired me to determine what characteristics of my life contribute to my happiness.


<br><hr>
I believe that the capitalist system that America is built upon is the root of this "pursuit of happiness" that has become so integral in our society. However, the forms of happiness we chase are often in money and material things, but while we may think that happiness is found in these things, only greed lies there. Happiness is something that comes naturally for the most part when you do something with a passion, and it does not have to be found. This materialistic mindset has corrupted us not only culturally and economically, but environmentally as well. The worst part of this environmental crisis is that it is often not taken as a serious and imminent threat, but as a mere collateral damage in the pursuit of capital gain. I completely agree with you in that we should strive to define our own successes rather than basing it on what society has predetermined to be coined as successful, whether this be in financial assets, career, etc. I think that once the mindset of the personal gain is lost, then you become more in-tune with your surroundings and your community, thus you become more environmentally conscious.
<br><hr>
I am moved by your comment because I recognized the same pattern in our society. We do live in a society- a society that  shapes us with their expectations. Especially, with the social media being the dominant recipient of our attention, we can look into people's lives with one click of a button. And with that, we often tend to compare ourselves with the capitalist lifestyles that we see in our screens. Because of that tendencies, our perception of happiness is corrupted by the capitalist ideals. We are part of the issue, because we demand for this kinds of lifestyle. We like and share videos of expensive food, expensive get-aways, and all luxurious amenities that we leach-off from the environment. It's not our true motive to hurt our mother earth, but it is definitely our shift in priorities. We are so stuck in a fast paced digitized and virtual modernization that our the level of satisfaction that we are looking for are entirely reliant on the collectives influence. 
        <br><br>
I think we understand that money can't buy as permanent happiness, however it also true with money comes power and with power comes America.

<br><hr>
I thought it was very interesting to consider not just the science of climate change but the motivations behind it and how we can adapt to a possibly healthier lifestyle. So far, I continue to see how the climate crisis is driven by greed.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with the statements that you made about happiness. Happiness is something that we have been conditioned to believe that we can achieve by being successful and making a lot of money in this materialistic society. However, it is important to note that even if we do achieve these things we still cannot achieve that "happiness". Happiness is the ultimate goal for everyone and by destroying the earth and making it an environment that will become unlivable, we are destroying our chances at every achieving that happiness. The example relating to Japan and how people work until their death just to earn money really resonates with me. I am particularly fascinated with the Japanese culture and have seen a lot of documentaries highlighting this. It is true that the Japanese work culture is one that includes long hours and the phenomenon "death by overworking" is extremely true, particularly in Japan. This scares me because compared to Sweden and Denmark where they have developed a more efficient way of living, the people there are much happier. The happiest countries are the ones that don't require you to have nice luxury cars and items and huge mansions. I believe that it is of upmost importance that we reevaluate our lives and our definitions of happiness and put into context what exactly it is that will lead us to live a happy life. This movie made me really evaluate my own perspective on things and what I find valuable.
<br><hr>
I also really enjoyed the comparison of different lifestyles around the world. I think that we are very influenced by the lifestyles around us and that a lot of our happiness is based off of things that are important to our peers. When in reality we can find people of all walks of like and all backgrounds that are happy. It shows just how much of the stuff we have is not necessary and doesn't necessarily give us happiness. I think people who live in the USA need to stop basing their happiness on consumerism to truly try and make an environmental impact.
<br><hr>
The title of the movie has already indicated the main topic of the movie which is happy. It says that more and more people nowadays focus on the measure of happiness which is not seems as important before. Also, many researches show that 50 percent happiness is caused by genetic. In the movie, it introduces a lot of people that may happy or not. A man who has surfing for 40 years says that it is happy for him to surf because surfing is the thing that he like. Also, he encourages his son and daughter whatever they want to be in the future, they should try it which can make them happy. A woman who got an accident which turned her beautiful face into a weird one used to be hopeless because her husband left her, and she also lost a perfect face. However, after she met a man who encouraged her to live better, she said that her life changed suddenly, and they got married which helped her find the happiness in her life again. Moreover, the movie indicates that Japan has the least happiness around the world due to the heavy working stress. I think the director want to demonstrate that it is hard to measure happiness for different kinds of people. In the end, a man who work as a volunteer says that maybe a little water is not useful for you at all, but it may help or even save others. Therefore, happiness is depending on what has changed on a single person. The more happiness you have, the world would be happier.

<br><hr>
I agree with you in regard to how the film effectively presented a variety of happy sustainable lifestyles. It is important that the general public realizes that consumerism is not the key to happiness. There are many environmentally friendly lifestyles that one can have and still be happy and satisfied with life. I agree that people do need to reflect on what really makes them happy. It is saddening that our society has been heavily influenced by advertisements and marketing into believing that consumerism is a key component of finding happiness. Instead, people need to realize that instant gratification from materialism fades away while happiness from kindness and community is more profound. In order to achieve this, our society as a whole needs to change by redefining what being successful is. People need to focus on more personal improvements rather than working just for the sake of wealth.

<br><hr>
The manner in which America has defined happiness and success is through a purely capitalist viewpoint. America has always been portrayed as a prosperous land of bounty, and our ambitions have definitely nurtured this value. My hometown is primarily made up of working-class families who have to make money stretch in order to provide. If you ask any of them what they wish for,  many would simply ask for money, or property. This is what America has defined as happiness. Our visions of happiness are often romanticized with grandeur and unending wealth. while many may be happier with these things, many find themselves disillusioned after attaining all the "happiness" they sought. After watching "Happy", I have been given an eye into a perspective I had not yet realized: simplicity is key.

I thought the most interesting part of the entire film was the section about dopamine, the chemical that pretty much determines someone's happiness. People in the film mentioned that in order to be happier, you must seek out experiences that release or require dopamine in order to maintain dopamine synapses in the brain. These experiences might include aerobic exercises, playing an instrument, and other activities that produce "flow" and "put you in the zone". This made me think about the things I do that "put me in the zone." I thought about acting, singing, painting, cooking, writing, and even talking to other people. I know these activities make me happier in general, but I wanted to think about what specifically happens whenever I'm engaged in the flow. I thought really hard, and I realized that there are two important things that I do:
        <br><br>

Firstly, I become utterly focused on the work I'm doing. My mind is nowhere else and I am completely in the moment. My brain suddenly transforms from a bunch of crossing highways and intersections into one straight and empty road. This makes me forget about all of my problems. 
        <br><br>

Secondly, while I'm completely in the moment, I am also thinking ahead. For example, while I play the piano I'm thinking about the notes that come next or while I paint I'm thinking about the bigger picture at the end. 
        <br><br>

I thought about how interesting it was that in all of my favorite activities, I am prompted to think about both the present and the future at the same exact time. When I'm not "in the zone", my mind is all over the place and I'm usually just thinking about what's happening in the moment or what's going to happen in the future. Rarely do I combine these two thought processes.
        <br><br>

For some odd reason, I started thinking about time travel. I know that time travel machines aren't real and people can't actually go to the past, but I deeply feel as though these euphoric dopamine-releasing moments are the closest thing we have to science fiction's form of "time travel". Think about it: when you're doing these activities, you become so absorbed that it's almost as though time slows down, speeds up, or stops all together. In reality, however, time remains at a constant pace. This might make you feel like you are separate from time or in a different reality. That made me think about one of my favorite poems "Ode on a Grecian Urn" by John Keats. It talks about how art and nature are so beautiful that they transcend time. Therefore, when you engage in art and nature, you might feel like you're taken to a different reality, one that is better -- because without time, there are no problems. Then, I thought about the song "Pocketful of Sunshine" by Natasha Bedingfield. In it, she sings about a "sweet escape". In the bridge of the song, she explains her "sweet escape" in more detail with the following lyrics: "there's a place that I go, where nobody knows. Where the rivers flow, and I call it home. And there's no more lies. In the darkness, there's light. And nobody cries. There's only butterflies." She's describing a place she goes where there's no people, problems, or negativity. This "sweet escape" has features of nature such as rivers, light, and butterflies. Now, if you think about the title of the song, you might wonder, what is a pocketful of sunshine? I personally believe it is a metaphor for capturing the happiness you feel when you're in your "sweet escape" and bringing it with you wherever you go.
        <br><br>

I understand that I am not a scientist and I don't know much about the complexity of the brain or neurotransmitters such as dopamine. However, while dopamine clearly causes a spike in happiness in the moment, once you're done with the dopamine-releasing activity, levels will eventually go back down. Nevertheless, both your mind and body are left with the invigorating and everlasting memory of how that experience made you feel, otherwise known as a "pocketful of sunshine". Therefore, you have a continuous desire to reengage in that activity and renew those beautiful feelings. It's something to look forward to, 24/7. That's why I have my hobbies, and that's why they make me so happy!
        <br><br>

People always say "you can't have pleasure without pain". I agree with the statement, but I also believe the opposite is true. You can't get through pain without pleasure. In "Pocketful of Sunshine" Bedingfield sings "do what you want, but you're never gonna break me. Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me." She claims to be very strong, positive, and resilient. In the film, they state that "one of the key ingredients to happiness is being able to recover from adversity more quickly. It’s not that people who are happy don’t respond to adversity -- they do -- but they come back to baseline more quickly." When equipped with a pocketful of sunshine from an individual's personal sweet escape, one is able bounce back more quickly when bad things happen, knowing that the good things are great -- and that life is worth living no matter how hard it gets.
        <br><br>

That is why I believe that people who think money can make them happy don't know what happy really is. You can have a pocketful of money, but that doesn't mean you have a pocketful of sunshine. In fact, it leaves less room for it. This is symbolic for the idea that overbearing capitalism is blurring our true vision of what happiness really is and making it harder for us to reach it. It's tricking us into thinking that true happiness comes from status, wealth, and image (the three extrinsic goals). Rather, it comes from doing what you love and connecting with others (the two intrinsic goals). The three extrinsic aspects of life can vanish in an instant, whereas the intrinsic sources of happiness will be around as long as life lasts.
        <br><br>

If someone's house burns down, it is normal for them to feel devastated and depressed. Positivity is key in order to pull themselves out of the sadness. If they have previously built a life focused on intrinsic goals, they can find happiness again by turning to memories of doing what they love, connecting with others, and realizing that those things will exist forever and that therefore life is worth living. However, if they have previously built a life focused on extrinsic goals, they will have a much harder time pulling themselves out of the devastation, as they will lack the enlivening memories that would otherwise allow them to do so.
        <br><br>

This makes me think about the poem "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" by William Wordsworth. In it he recounts a time where he saw a beautiful sight of daffodils. Little did he know in the moment of the power of the encounter. He writes "I gazed—and gazed—but little thought / What wealth the show to me had brought: / For oft, when on my couch I lie / In vacant or in pensive mood, / They flash upon that inward eye / Which is the bliss of solitude; / And then my heart with pleasure fills, / And dances with the daffodils." He turns to the memory as a constant source of joy, and that is the beauty of life.

I appreciate the time and effort you had put into this comment and I really agree with most of the points you make. The science behind happiness is a really interesting one. As we learned from and this video that our brain produces dopamine when we are happy. Last quarter in a psychology class we took, we spent a whole unit talking about positive Psychology and what we can do to improve our mental well-being. Generally speaking, engaging in social interaction, enough money for food and shelter, exercising and practicing giving back contribute to one’s happiness the most. Meanwhile we talked about how and why people were stressed and what can people do to cope with it. On the other side, I like how a professor in the film mentioned “if you say either money buys happiness and money doesn’t buy happiness then you are both wrong”. Indeed, money does contribute to happiness to a point, but as the amount of wealth one accumulates increases, the correlation flattens out. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, isn’t it crazy that there is such a huge disparity in happiness in two different countries on the different side of the world? Hearing stories of children being ignored by their parents due to their work is definitely no strange tales, as I’ve known some of my friends been through this before too. Contractually, people who seek for extrinsic values live a way better live -- those who seek for simplicity, personal growth and genuine human connections. Hearing the wholesome accounts of co housing and the island in Japan makes me very happy. I am so glad they who came from different places are able to bond as a family in the big community and look out for each other. Imagine how society would be like if we live for genuine connection with each other?
<br><hr>
I agree with so many of your points.  I also play a musical instrument (trumpet) and when I get going, I start hyper focusing on my playing.  I stop worrying about everything else and the only thoughts I am having relate to what I am about to play next.  Though I was generally aware of dopamine and how it works, I failed to understand just how much it shapes my everyday life.  

<br><br>

Whenever I am doing work or planning out my evening, I try to put at least half an hour of a hobby because I know I will be more effective after the break.  Furthermore, I have found that the amount of discretionary income I have does not significantly affect my happiness.  As long as I have enough to buy food and go to weekly comedy shows with friends, I am generally satisfied.  This is interesting, as it ties into the point that money does not buy happiness, after a certain point.  

<br><br>

Lastly, I found it interesting how people from all walks of life can be so happy, even when most of us would consider their daily life unpleasant at the least.  This is another clue that wealth is not the key measure of happiness.  These people find a reason to be happy and then do their best to stay that way.
<br><hr>
This movie also made me think about the things I do that make me happy: going to the beach, singing, hot-tubbing, napping, hanging out with friends, talking to other people, singing, driving, playing soccer, etc. It is important to be happy in life. Without happiness, what's the point? They say that the main goal in life is to be happy, and I agree. I strive to be happy everyday. Sometimes it is hard. Sometimes when I am going through a rough time, nothing feels right. But I know everything will be okay, if I just believe it will be. "Eventually things will get better," I tell myself.

<br><hr>
I can really relate to your thoughts on being in the zone. I experience thinking about what is going on and what is going to happen at the same time when I play volleyball or figure skate. There is nothing on my mind except where the ball is or what move I'm going to do. Every time I play a game, I feel so good afterwards. I feel like there's not a thing in the world that could bother me. Around midterm or final weeks, I tend to feel stressed out and unable to focus unless I do some sort of sport to let off my steam. 
<br><br>
I think if I'm content on the inside, I don't think as much about my processions. Being overly obsessed about having lots of stuff is one of the reasons people are less happy and use up more energy to make stuff to fill up the hole in their heart. If everyone can be find happiness from the inside, a major cause of climate crisis can be solved.
<br><hr>
amazing comment!

<br><hr>
You have such a wholesome outlook on life and I really admire that! :)) I really resonated with your point about how our past memories and finding meaning in our lives can draw us out of hard times of pain because it's completely true. We live in such a fast paced society that we spend most of our precious moments alive in a robotic way of life filled with repetitive, meaningless routines that are not memorable or beneficial to us in the slightest. There is never any time taken for personal reflection unless it is about something negative like worrying about a mistake or regretting missed opportunities which I find truly sad. I too have found myself going through the motions as a student who has many responsibilities and pressures to succeed in my academics, and often find myself forgetting to realize that there is always more to life than just studying and stressing about work. We find joy and meaning things like our relationships with the people we love as well as new experiences that teach us more about ourselves. Picking up hobbies like you said is one way to keep a little happiness and pride in ourselves, serving as a distraction for times when life gets a little hard. Besides, those are the only things we can take with us through the passage of time so more time should be invested in that. Obviously that's not to say we should all be quitting our jobs and leaving school to go live in the forest unbothered by the confines of society, but it doesn't mean we can't take a break from our busy lives time to time to really enjoy the little things that make us happy. 
<br><br>

I admit I do struggle with finding that balance between things that make me truly happy and my other responsibilities like school. I know also that I am not alone in that struggle, because everyone battles with their own pressures and issues that barr them from feeling true happiness and freedom. It takes some real introspection and thought for people to understand what is good for them and what is not, and not everyone takes the time to do so. For me personally, I would really like to strengthen the personal relationships I have with people in my life and devote more time for bettering myself. Even if that is a small step considering that many factors play a part in individual happiness, I think that at least it's somewhere to start.

<br><hr>

Loved reading this comment from beginning to end! It was very well thought out and I thought the connections to the song “Pocket full of Sunshine” were gold. I’ve personally noticed that having a more grounded/positive mind set has allowed me to be happier or to have the ability to get over things that dampen my mood quicker over these past couple months. I don’t continuously think about the long road ahead of me that I have relating to school, but rather stay in the present moment and take it day by day. I’ve realized that stressing about those things doesn’t resolve anything but rather causes me more problems. 
<br><br>
In regard to the chemical aspect of things, I’ve also become more active since I moved here to Santa Barbara and that could be a factor of my happiness. As you stated, “aerobic exercises…and other activities that produce "flow" and "put you in the zone”, whenever I’m biking to school or along the ocean I seem to forget about things and I’m “in the zone” just vibing with my surroundings and feel bliss. I don’t need all of those material things and I defiantly know that I do not need money to have fun, I’m experiencing it now, living the broke college life and still vibing with my friends.

I agree with you that I found the mentioning of dopamine most interesting. It is the neurotransmitter that sends signals to other nerves cell, which allow the feeling of pleasure and happiness. As we grow older, we slowly lose our dopamine, but we can exercise, which best releases dopamine. Accordingly, physical activity sparks delight and spiritual needs for us to recover from adversity. We are told in the society that it is money that makes us happy; however, it is not necessarily true. Money is a necessity, but it never truly means happiness.
<br><br>


Similarly, in the pursuit of economic development, people and society have lost the culture, environment. I like how the film points out that it is the government’s responsibility to create a society with happiness and protect civilization. For example, in Denmark, people have free education, health care for life, and co-housing communities, which has a vast range of national happiness. This film conveys many optimistic views not only on environmental issues but also on life in general. Happiness is free. Sharing and caring for each other is what our society should seek for, and we should also include nature as our friends, our source of happiness.

exactly! I believe that a big part of finding something that makes you happy is finding something that you don't have to worry about losing. Ultimately, the only thing you can never really lose is yourself. Therefore, your happiness must come from within. That's why you have to do what you love!

<br><hr>
I completely agree that people who rely on money for happiness have no true understanding of the concept. In my Zen Buddhism class, we talked about the impermanence of objects. In your example of someone's house burning down and them being sad as a result of it, they would only be sad if they had not already detached themselves from the idea and relied on the house as a permanent source of stability and happiness. I think minimalism is accepting that objects are impermanent and unimportant to our larger purpose of happiness, and they are more fleeting than the emotional value you gain from going through an experience that helps you grow and makes you truly happy with yourself on a deeper level. The film "Happy" showed us lifestyles of people in non-western countries who generally ranked as happier and more satisfied with life than Americans. The key aspects that I noted in these happier lifestyles was living more based on experiences and bonding rather than materialism. Luxury seems to be more about free time than it is about owning more, and I think that having free and positively used time (to build our communities, our hobbies, and ourselves as individuals) is more effective in living a happy lifestyle than accumulating impermanent objects that only tether us to things that can be lost. You can never lose an experience; I, for example, will never forget how much fun I had going ziplining with my best friend on a day trip in Mexico, but you can lose objects (ex. while I was happy when I bought my car, I was sad when I got in an accident and couldn't drive it for a while). This film does a really good job of calling out the hyper-consumerism in American culture that plagues us and tricks us into a false sense of happiness, drawing us further away from the true joy of new experiences and relationship building.

I think that the flow state can be achieved in many different ways, and something that does it for me is making coffee in the morning. Maybe it is also the caffeine addiction, but something about measuring coffee beans, smelling them, grinding them up, and boiling water is really rewarding, and the actual coffee is just kind of a bonus. I think everyone has their own things that are kind of meditative, and it is important to recognize them and do them more often.
<br><br>
This documentary did a good job in underscoring how money has very little to do with happiness after a certain point. Relationships, family and helping others has far greater impact.

At first, I was a bit shocked by the length of this comment, but as I started reading it, I was really enjoying reading your comment. I can see your deep thought into the subject of happiness, which I believe is very important to be pondered upon for everyone. Since by doing that people are likely to start being aware of and pursue their happiness. I remember when I was younger and thought about “what is the meaning of life”, and one answer that came to my mind is pursing happiness, and this film, Ken’s explanation, and your comment provides more interesting and well-thought-out opinions on what comprises the authentic and long-lasting happiness, which tends to be more focused on internal factors such as connection with others, pursuit of personal growth, and contribution to the community, as mentioned in the film. I think this is consistent with Maslow’s demands pyramid that lists people’s different level of demands, in which the button level is physiological needs like food and housing and the top level is to maximize one’s potential (to make the world a better place, in my interpretation). 
 <br><br>

Moreover, I really, really like your notion of “You can't get through pain without pleasure”, and I think this is especially true for me to do some drab homework while listening my loved songs, as a simple example. Nevertheless, this idea can be traced in many parts of my life, but I haven’t really been aware of that, so I like this idea very much. I also found your wording is very sweet and warm: “When equipped with a pocketful of sunshine from an individual's personal sweet escape, one is able bounce back more quickly when bad things happen, knowing that the good things are great -- and that life is worth living no matter how hard it gets.”Honestly, I felt warm and nice while reading this, as the wording is so lovely. More importantly, I think the idea is also true, as if one clearly knows the direction or goal that one is pursuing and knows the things one should treasure and love, then the person is very unlikely to feel desperate when encountered some difficulties. The belief that the world can be great and that we can make the world a better place can be power to a person, which is derived from our love, confidence, and hard-working.
 <br><br>

Lastly, I also think that pursing the happiness of not only ourselves but others, and even other species and our environment is probably one central idea behind our pursuit of making the world a better place. While I think it is important to manage one’s life well first and then help the others, this is still a nice thing to pursue as eventually, we will live well and happily when people around us are happy and when the ecosystem, nature, or environment is well, right? This reminds me a saying: the nature can go on without human, but we human cannot sustain without the nature.
<br><hr>

You provided a very distinct and unique perspective that I didn't think about before. I defiantly liked the part in your comment when you mention the elaborate thing that is happiness and being "in the zone." When I'm in the zone defiantly it feels as if time slows down or speeds up, and I am just living in the moment without any concept of time. I am able to relate this feeling for example when I am running and I am playing music that takes me to a time in life where I was at my most happiest. I personally do not like running but when I run I put on EDM music that makes me think about the time when I was at a rave and was listening to this music. As I start running and the music plays I focus on the music and I Let it be my only focus. I then think back to the feelings that I felt where I was listening this music and I completely forget that I am running and the pain that I feel but instead I travel back in time to the emotions I felt and use that to keep running. I never really identified it till you mentioned it right now. Happiness is such complex emotion and it is something that we should all focus on doing more. Happiness comes from memories and interactions with life, not something completely materialistic. We must try our hardest to not let the consumer ideology control our happiness we must Identify it ourselves what makes us happy.
<br><hr>
I really love your take on this film! When they laid out the 3 intrinsic and 3 external goals, that really struck a chord with me. Some people spend their lives chasing the external goals: money, status, and image. While they think these will bring them happiness, time and again these fail to satisfy them and they get stuck on the hedonic treadmill, always growing complacent and wanting more. The three internal goals however, have proven to increase happiness levels: personal growth, relationships, and the desire to help. As the film pointed out, those who ranked happiest consistently had close, supportive family and friends. As I’ve come to realize over the past year, human relationships really are the point of life. I’ve grown so much this year and finally started working to let myself depend on other people instead of self-isolating and relying only on myself, and I’ve found that people really do want to help. In working on this, I’ve developed two of the closest friendships that I’ve ever had, and I truly don’t know what I would’ve done this quarter if I didn’t have those two friends supporting me.
 <br><br>


I also found the idea of “flow” to be really interesting. I’m never happier than when I’m “in the zone,” so to speak, whether that be while dancing, drawing, singing, reading, or hanging out with friends. As you pointed out, it’s in moments like these where it feels like time stops and I’m able to be fully present and in the moment. This is, I think, one of the most important ways to cultivate happiness: being present. While it sounds simple, it’s much easier said than done and I often find myself worrying about the future or regretting the past when truly I should be focusing on the present moment. A friend of mine recently adopted the saying “Be present,” and it’s honestly had a big impact on how I view the world.

The documentary “Happy” made me realize that not everyone on earth experiences the same feeling of dissatisfaction as we do in the United States. Although the average citizen here has objectively more than many people across the world, we continually rank lower in terms of happiness. What made me hopeful was when the documentary highlighted a rickshaw driver in India, and a tribe in Africa; the commonality between them was that neither group had much money, or material wealth that was visible, yet they were both so completely content with their life. Specifically the rickshaw driver in India, he had a growing family, and he said his home was often in the pathways of monsoons. However, even though he had these troubles, he said his greatest joy was being with his family, and living well through their familial connections. Something I think society in the United States could use more of is human connection, not surface level greetings, but real, interpersonal connections. Parents (like the fathers in Japan) often work long hours, with good intentions, because they feel that making money and providing material wealth is the greatest way that they can provide for their families and show love; but that’s not what children really want. We want real time with our parents, time spent together laughing, playing, and making memories (not memories of gifts bought and hours spent working). I know this is not realistic for everyone, some people have manual labor jobs that require long, exhaustive hours. However, I hope that if the whole American ideal of working all your life changed, it could change for every level of worker, not just those at corporate levels. 
 <br><br>

Moreover, this film emphasized the importance of complacency. In the United States we always tend to push ourselves for more, but not more of the things that matter. We shoot for more money, more promotions, more property— all of these are just meaningless accolades. In reality we should be pushing for more compassion, towards each other (and effectively towards the planet). Once our relationships with each other become more meaningful than our relationships with stuff, I think stopping the mass consumerism that has influenced the climate crisis will come naturally.

I agree, I found it incredibly interesting that as Americans, we experience lower levels of happiness when compared to other countries on earth. In my opinion, the reason we aren’t as happy is because we are constantly bombarded with these ideals of being wealthy and materialistic. Its practically shoved down our throats as kids, we learn what our society values of us before we learn what we personally value. I’ve stopped thinking of America as a nation and began thinking of it as a business. In the documentary, we saw that people who we would consider as having terrible lives, actually enjoy their lives just as much as everyone else. This could be due to their society having different values and them possibly not knowing the extent to which they have it worse than others. That’s another problem that America has, we are shown how the top 1% lives and suddenly we aren’t content with what we have. We are constantly trying to have more and better things and a lot of the time we don’t even know why we want these things. Ken poses the question; will we be happier if we implement these environmental reconstruction legislations? Honestly, I don’t think that will make us happier, I believe that the best way to make us a happier nation is to change the cultural value of materialistic goods and highlight being a good person as a desirable trait. Because in our current form, you can’t go a day without seeing happier people on your phone every time you check snapchat, or Instagram, you see people “living the dream” and you are stuck sitting thinking, why can’t that be me? Instead of asking, Are they any happier than me? How much of what they post is for show, like a persona? In short, until America switches its values away from material wealth, we will continue to be more and more unhappy.


<br><hr>

I couldn’t agree with you more about society needing more human connection! As Doctor Diener said in the film, the studies show that the happiest people have close family and friends. Spending time with people and growing relationships with others is a sustainable form of happiness, unlike the fleeting joy that is felt when people go shopping. Buying things is a way that some people try to fill a void, but because of the hedonic treadmill, they will never truly feel fulfilled until they can break the cycle. Your comment about striving for more compassion towards one another and consequently, our planet resonated with me because I, too feel that empathy is an interconnected link between people, animals, and the planet. 

 <br><br>

Obviously, parents have to work to provide for their families and I remember growing up thinking that I would rather just spend time with my mom as you said. My mom would always be working or too tired from work to do anything, but she always prided herself in providing financially for the family because as a single mom, she had to. Unfortunately, the need to work leaves parents with no time to spend with their families since Americans work well over 40 hours a week. I’ve always said that I would want to be around for my future kids as they’re growing up and not have to work that much, but only a privileged few can afford to do that. The idea of implementing new full-time hours to be around 30 hours would benefit the quality of life for most Americans leaving more time for family, friends, and honestly just relaxing.
<br><hr>
Wow, your comment really struck me.
 <br><br>

This documentary made me think of my dad. He arrived in the United States when he was 18 to go to school. He pursued the standard American dream and worked tirelessly to climb the ladder of professional and monetary success. As he continued down this path he began checking things off his list of things to do be successful and happy: earning a degree, landing a high paying job with room to ascend, getting married, moving to the suburbs closer to work, being promoted, having kids, promoted again, winning company awards, buying a nice car, moving with his job, promoted again, moving again. And so on. In his efforts to achieve what he thought would bring him happiness, he forgot to appreciate what he had. He’s in his 60s now, financially exceptional, unhappy, and completely alone.
 <br><br>

While I can appreciate the immense amount of work and time he sank into his career to allow me to comfortably grow up and ultimately attend this university, I still feel he could have done things differently and been happier. We would likely be closer. I think the American ideal of individually searching for happiness is a lonely and profit driven scheme that contributes to the workforce and our economy. By insisting that extrinsic values such as money, image, and status will bring happiness rather than intrinsic values such as personal growth, relationships, and altruism, not only do we damage our planet (increasing consumerism in transport, housing, clothing, food, etc.) but we also damage ourselves.
 <br><br>

I think the climate crisis is an opportunity to rethink what is truly important. Our generation is coming of age at the end of the fucking world, so we need to ask ourselves what we really value: happiness, compassion, family, creativity, and love, or image, things, power, status, and money?

<br><hr>

I totally agree with you. I really enjoyed this documentary and the ways it both directly and indirectly relates to the topics of this class. This topic is one that fascinates me deeply and I’m so glad I had the chance to watch this film. The consumerist path to happiness is one that plagues my generation and myself deeply. We online shop and go out to eat saying that we just need it. The amount of times I've gone shopping because I'm feeling down is way too much. Of course I realize that this does not lead to eternal happiness, but I don't think I have fully analyzed how toxic of a behavior it really is. Not only is this a crutch and a purposeless cycle, it is also harmful to our earth. The outlets that Americans believe lead to happiness are so often harmful to ourselves and our planet. We live in this society that tells us bigger is better without exception. Many of us attending this university right now are under similar influences. We believe we will make more money if we major in certain things and will go throughout life with this mindset. Once we graduate and get a job, it will be about the next big promotion, the bigger house, the better car, and so on. This mindset of the American Dream, conditions us to never be content with what we have, damaging our happiness and our planet in the meantime. 
 <br><br>
Another aspect of this film that I found very interesting was the breakdown percentages that make up one’s happiness. The figure that 50% of our happiness is genetic and everyone is born with a set range of happiness scale is so interesting to me. We think that when we achieve certain things we will be happy forever, when this just isn’t true. We need to stop striving for the things that we think will bring us happiness and cultivate our own happiness in healthy outlets everyday. The importance of a flow and intentional activity was very cool to me. It makes so much sense that extracurriculars like sports or music enrich our lives and lead to heightened happiness. If we find the things that bring us peace and happiness and stop relying on material goods and excess we will help ourselves and our planet.

<br><hr>
I agree that we as a country should connect with each other more. It is interesting how some people that don't have much are still happy because they have strong relationships with family and friends. I feel like friendships can make you happy because you're surrounding yourself with people you care about. I feel like money eventually makes us unhappy because it makes us want more and we become less satisfied with the things we have. There also comes a time where money can't solve all our problems - you can't buy friends with money. It's a shame how Japan has such a rigorous working culture that treats people like machines. While work is important, there must be time for our personal lives. Since ancient times, we survived by relying on each other and working as a team. The people we surround ourselves with can impact us. I think that in order to be happy, we should spend time with the people we care about and form bonds with others. Money is important but it can't buy true happiness.
<br><hr>
I wholeheartedly agree that consumer culture is a major problem in the way of reducing carbon emissions and just being happy in general. As exemplified by the rickshaw driver in India, money and material things really do not determine a satisfying or happy life. U.S. culture seems to have idea twisted and completely removed the idea of being content with the connections you form from family and friendships, and measuring how happy you are through the strength of those connections. Nowadays, we strive for that new car or new home, and some new clothes to accompany your future status change. Everything has become about image and status based off of what you own. In this way, people will never be satisfied and always slaving over the next new thing.
<br><hr>
I strongly agree with you. To be honest, people are a group of greedy creatures. Even though we live in a developed society and we do not need to worry about whether we will be starved, the happiness we have is even lower than people who are from some country where the living conditions are much worse than us. It is a ridiculous thing, isn’t it?
 <br><br>
I was also impressed by that driver in India. He felt happy not because of how rich he is and how successful he is; instead of it, he felt happy is just because he can stay with his family. By contrast, the living environment in my home country emphasizes that everyone should spend time to earn more money, to become more successful, to have a higher hierarchy in the society, and to have more power. Thanks to my parents, who are a group of people that know how to balance the family and their work. I grow up happier than many of my friends. They spend a huge amount of time watching and attending every step on my way of growing up. Our family felt happy about this. However, this does not mean that parents who spend a lot of time working and earning money did not love their children. They want to offer their children a much better living condition. Nevertheless, from my perspective, what I really want is to have a talk with my parents about some interesting things that happen during my school time every week. I want them to know more about their children instead of just giving money to me.
 <br><br>
Realizing this, I believe people who watch this movie will be influenced and realize that actually, there are a lot of things that can make us feel much happier than working and making money. People are always greedy and cannot be satisfied. We should spend a little bit of time to stop and reflect on what we have lost in order to get more money. Is it worth it?


<br><hr>
I like the conclusion that you reached at the end of your comment. Instead of consumerism, we should be pushing for more compassion, towards each other (and effectively towards the planet) and how our growth in meaningful relationships would result in the halt of mass consumerism that influences the climate crisis. I appreciate how this movie was about happiness, yet definitely connected to the theme of this course. The movie emphasized how different parts of the world measure and prioritize happiness, yet acknowledged not everyone achieves happiness in the same way. However, “the things we love to do are the building blocks to a happy life.” I love that. Because we all tend to love the same things: playing, having new experiences, spending time with friends and family, doing things that are meaningful, and appreciating what we have. 
 <br><br>

If we did focus on materialism, we’d ultimately be living a happier and a more eco-friendly life. Appreciating what we have sticks out because it underscores minimalism and how we always consume and find ourselves unsatisfied and look for more. Instead, we should seek what we love and appreciate its entirety. Moreover, things that make us happy are outside of things we can buy, such as experiences and time with loved ones.
 <br><br>

Meanwhile, I would like to highlight Bhutan. The film acknowledged that third world countries, in pursuit of economic development, their societies lose culture, environment, and social systems. Bhutan proves to be more intellectual though, as the country realized humanity needed a higher goal for development which is gross national happiness. Happiness is the focal point, not profit. This claims that you do not need a lot of money to be happy; instead of trying to maximize gross national product, they work towards maximizing gross national happiness and what will make people happy, not rich. It’s fascinating that under Bhutan’s mindset, gross national happiness is the responsibility of the government. This guides people to think rationally and spiritually, realizing what they find important and prioritizing that. They begin to speak up and it turns out people care about their environment and buildings of cultural significance.
 <br><br>

This relates to the climate crisis because when natural disasters occur due to human-caused climate change, people are upset. They lose their beautiful valleys and forests and these natural disaasters can also destroy buildings of importance to them. They also need to evacuate, leaving their belongings, ruining their convenience, and worrying for their safety. Moreover, upholding and protecting what the people want is considered the government’s responsibility. If people care about the earth, then this prompts legislation that embodies ideals similar to the Green New Deal.
 <br><br>

Another example is Denmark. It’s called the happiest country and ensures free education and free healthcare for life. Surprisingly, more of the population can be found in co-housing communities than any other nation, typically in the same plot of land or even infrastructure. Multiple families live in the same place and the responsibilities are shared. This creates bonds between people and less of a workload. And these things have been constantly talked about as legislation expected within the Green New Deal as well as solutions to combat climate change.
 <br><br>

Ken’s lecture also brings up that their emissions are only a portion of the United States, despite their location in a more demanding area. This area is demanding because it is more northern and thus colder. And when areas are colder, populations are more prone to experience seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression that's related to changes in season, yet its statistics prove it to have high happiness rates. Seems to be the lifestyle.
<br><hr>
I agree. I never really thought of it that way - despite how much we as Americans have, we always have that desire for more. I think that this has to do with our materialistic childhoods and the constant mentality of striving for wealth and success. Hell, that’s honestly the main reason that I decided to come to college. It’s really unfortunate because at times it feels like no matter how many things that I get or how many goals I may achieve, it doesn’t feel like enough; there’s always that sense of wanting more. However, this documentary was very eye opening for me. Seeing other cultures thrive in the sense of happiness when their realities are seen as “bad” by Americans in terms of quality made me reconsider what’s truly important. I feel like more Americans need to have some sort of similar epiphany in an effort to reduce their sense of consumerism in order to have a direct impact on the climate.

<br><hr>
Hi, I agree with you! I love watching the documentary "Happy" because it gives you so many different perspectives. Because I have grown up in the U.S. I feel like the idea of money and image and status have always been thrown in my face as something that achieves happiness. I know this is not true but our culture really pushes these ideas on us. This is what leads to so much consumerism in the U.S. which is why analyzing happiness is important to rethink for the sake of the climate crisis. With that said I think it was cool to see so many other places that are happy not because of consumerism or money but because of relationships and acts of kindness and community. I really enjoyed the part about the mother who moved into a communal living area in Copenhagen. I think this was a great example of how many of us should live because it would be better for the environment but also better for our happiness. I think this example really demonstrates how we can change our way of living and not losing anything but actually gaining a happier life.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. I think the most meaningful part of this film was seeing how people who are so much poorer, live in worse conditions, and more cramped spaces than what most of us in the U.S. do, can live such happy, complacent lives. It was very touching to see people from developing countries talk about their lives in such a positive light, like the rickshaw driver in India. His home is humble and leaks when it rains but this problem is so minimal for him. I think the biggest difference between people like him and people in the U.S. is their ability to see the things that truly matter, they focus on the good in their lives, like family and love. The film really made me think about my own life, and how I was raised. My dad was raised with divorced parents, but he had money. He has always had everything he wanted, and so naturally as an adult he became a compulsive buyer. We try to tell him that the accumulation of things isn't making our lives better, if anything it only puts our family in a constant state of debt. He rationalizes his obsession by stating that he just wants to make the house beautiful for our family, and that once he finishes re-doing the yard or gets this new couch that he will be satisfied. For my entire life, my dad has been on this "hedonic treadmill" -- as they talked about in the film -- constantly wanting more and mistakenly assuming that he will eventually reach a sort of happiness. Living with my dad has taught me firsthand that this is not the case, and the real source of happiness isn't in what we own or where we live or even how much money we have, but all we really need is each other. Unfortunately, my father doesn't seem to understand that no matter how much my family tries to tell him. Even though this film didn't have much to do with environmentalism, it is so so important for people to watch and change their perspective. It gives real-life evidence of how unnecessary money is for our happiness. I hope that Americans can begin to realize this and re-evaluate their relationship with things, and with life in general. A change of perspective is what is needed to bring about the cultural changes needed to mitigate the climate crisis. I personally loved the idea of co-housing in Denmark, as well as shorter work weeks that Ken mentioned in the video. By adopting cultural and systemic changes like these, we will not only combat the climate crisis, but actually be happier. That vision is so appealing to me, and I think through effective communication, others will start to see it as well.
<br><hr>
Your last sentence really resonates with me, I fully agree that the transition away from mass consumerism will be an inevitable progression. Like you, I think the facts presented in the movie and Ken's introduction video regarding how various countries compare in terms of happiness foreshadow how America's pursuit of "happiness" will shift our culture. I think the examples you give provide examples of how happiness is based primarily on our human experiences, not in material wealth or objects. These examples reinforce what I've experienced in my own life. When I reflect on times of notable happiness, none of them are based directly on consumerism or attaining wealth. They primarily contain moments of human connection and experiences in nature. Even when I have been happy as a result of earning money or attaining a certain job, the feelings of happiness were based on a sense of personal achievement as a result of hard work, not the actual material results. 
 <br><br>
However, even though I agree that this societal shift can and likely will occur, I am still very conflicted on the issue of how this change is going to occur. My primary question is whether it will occur through government action or a natural societal move towards a different collective mindset. We have explored both ways in this class, by looking at personal and cultural change and legislation such as the Green New Deal. Personally, I think the most likely option is that there will be government action that mandates some change, which in turn will spark further cultural change.


<br><hr>
I really agree with the points you made in this comment. It seems as if everyone in the US is constantly wanting more and more, never being content with what we have. I also liked the comparison to people who experience happiness in other countries. The woman who got run over by a truck surely faced adversity and explained how she felt happier now. I do think that people who work more and are overly consumed by monetary wealth forget what makes them actually happy on a day to day basis and lose sight of what really matters. Society definitely needs more human connections to live a more positive lifestyle. Although Happy is not an environmental film, there are definitely parallels between happiness and the wellbeing of our planet. The American dream is now focused on bigger and better, but this has not made us happier. We have been pursuing happiness at cost at the planet and there seem to be no signs of change. The fact that people in Costa Rica are on average happier than people in the US, while people in the US are on average thirteen times wealthier truly highlights the points made.
<br><hr>
I am a firm believer that happiness is not created through anything other than community. On a personal scale, community looks like your friends, family, colleagues, schoolmates and peers. When our community ties are strong, and we believe in ourselves, happiness blooms. The idea that happiness springs from material goods is misconstrued. I loved this film because this is something I always think about. Happiness has been a struggle for me (and i believe most) throughout my life. And what I have come to realize is that the happiest moments for me come from deep connection made without distraction. Laughing around a campfire. Sleeping somewhere with a group of friends. Adventuring through the night and trying to find my way back home with people that I love. These moments are priceless and can never be bought. When we are content with ourselves, we are content with our world. It is a choice to yearn for more. If we can find the goodness in the nothingness, we are at peace. There are sacrifices that must be made always. We need money to sustain ourselves. But beyond that, real pleasure isn’t found in what we can squeeze in between what we need. It’s having people  to share ourselves with.

<br><hr>
I could not agree with you more on the fact that what makes us happy is not how much money we have but how much time we can spend with other families. People always want more money to get what they want and they do acquire a instantaneous happiness after they get what they want, but this kind of happiness never lasts long, and after that happiness disappears, the only thing you can feel is endless vagueness. Many parents believe earning as much as money is the way to show they love their children; I’m not going to refute this point, but I believe there is always a better way: more companionship. To be honest, I’m jealous of the attitude the India driver has and I think everyone should think what really makes them happy on their way to pursuing happiness.
<br><hr>
I agree with you! I found it pretty interesting how the countries that were ranked the happiest were those that had lower rates of gas emissions being put into the atmosphere. Americans are considered to be the ones with the most money and people always assume that happiness comes from money. So then why is the US ranked as the 19th happiest? I don't know about the rest of you, but if money is playing a factor then I would have thought the US would have been within the top 5.. right? I've come to the realization that happiness doesn't necessarily come from what you own or where you are from, but more from how you choose to live your everyday life.

I can see why America isn't one of the happiest countries out there. I feel like a lot of us are forced to work 9-5 jobs every single day just to get by and live comfortably, but at what cost? A lot of people working these kind of jobs become miserable and aren't out there doing what they love or what they have a passion for. We become unhappy with who we've become and why? Just because we think living in America means we really "made it?" 
 <br><br>
Honestly, I know I'm not the only one who thinks about this, but I do have times where I wonder how different life would have been if I was born and raised in a completely different country. Living and working in the US is supposed to be the "American Dream" but sometimes it feels like the opposite.

After finishing the film, a quote by Muhammad Ali came to mind: “The service you do for others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth”. I’ve read this quote multiple times in my life, but it makes more sense to me now than it ever did before. I think it’s interesting that Ali implies that humans are taking up “room” and that it is a requirement to pay for it by serving the less fortunate. Moreover, it asserts that people should understand that their presence on Earth is finite and that, at the end, all that matters is what you did for others.
 <br><br>


The fact that the happiest countries are those which follow a democratic socialist government is an important observation. Unfortunately, most Americans are reluctant to give it a chance, despite the statistics, because of our history. We despise monarchies, dictatorships, and the Cold War incited a deep hatred for communism, especially among the baby boomers. But, as far as I know, the younger generation is more open to a revolution, mostly because the American system no longer works the way it used to - not when the cost of rent increases faster than the minimum wage. I think democratic socialist countries have realized that although money doesn’t buy happiness, affordability does. So, things like healthcare and college being more affordable (and more available) may have increased prices for other things, but they obviously keep the nation happy. I know I’d be way happier if I knew I could visit the hospital without getting a bill worth thousands of dollars even if it meant I’d have to pay a little more for other luxuries.
 <br><br>


Lastly, one thing I think is crucial to being happy is having a support system. In American society, family is no longer one of the strongest values. It’s common to not have talked to your siblings in months, or not have seen your uncle in a while. However, as the Blanchard family and the cohousing system in Denmark prove, having people to support you is a huge contributor to happiness. I really think our society has to normalize being close to one’s family, or at least emphasize the importance of having a supportive group of people by your side. Plus, your carbon emissions decrease when you live with more people.

I totally agree with everything you have just said. I haven't heard that Muhammad Ali quote before but I think it applies perfectly here. I feel as well that it would be important for an American to learn HOW to be happy, given that they are living in this country where economic endeavors are valued so much higher above everything else. There is an interesting concept from hinduism which tells about the four proper goals for human life. The four "puruṣārthas" are Dharma (righteousness, moral values), Artha (prosperity, economic values), Kama (pleasure, love, psychological values) and Moksha (liberation, spiritual values). Many people will hear that money is not the way to happiness, and then completely disregard it, forgetting to acknowledge that there is nothing wrong with enjoying materialistic things, as long as they can be acknowledged as materialistic things. When materialism is confused with joy/peace/spirituality (not sure how people manage to do that, but it seems as though they use materialism as a substitution for these) then their life becomes very unbalanced very fast. I would say that a big part of the gift of life is enjoying everything that comes along with it.

I also agree that this film shed a lot of light on the happiness epidemic in the United States. The countries that follow or mimic a democratic socialist take on government tend to be the countries with the highest rates of happiness. This is because it levels the playing field for everyone in the game of life. It doesn't matter what class you were born into or where you were born but only taking advantage of what society has to offer. This is the ideology that is being promoted with happiness, coincidentally this happens to be the foundation of Bernie Sander's campaign. 
 <br><br>


 Your comment on the support system accurately shows a big hole in what people are missing. The United States values individualism and capitalism, both that shove enough community ideologies, however, a support system like this could be very effective if people are willing to push off the notion of material success. The epidemic lies within how our culture treats success and fuels this hedonistic drive for perpetual happiness. It is a futile endeavor.
<br><hr>

I too think that the Ali quote relates perfectly to environmental awareness and  the situation we currently face. I do find it quite interesting that countries with lower carbon emissions are found to be the happiest, and I don't believe that GDP has anything to do with the happiness of a country. While America may be viewed as a world superpower with all the luxury one could every wish for, also with the largest economy. However, this size and wealth isn't all it's made out to be. In actuality, this opens us up to a huge number of problems in our country. The root of these problems is the constant obsession with acquiring wealth and materials. I feel that a huge amount of many people's reasons to go to college is to be able to get a good job to then make money. After college, it's a rat race to make money, and every decision is made with money in mind. It's a sobering thought, as we realize that all life has in store in America is death and taxes. I'd love to be able to not have to worry about paying for health care or insurance, and would gladly take a larger tax to have these necessities covered.

The film Happy did an excellent job at covering this concept and the cycle of materialism that is destroying our planet. It's unfortunate, but the truth, and we must use our political action to begin to create change in our society for the better.

I think that is a super interesting Muhammad Ali quote that ties well to the climate crisis! It really does prove to be true that each of us impact someone else on this Earth. Every action we partake in will have an effect on others no matter how much we attempt to disprove that. Also, I believe it is important to have a strong support system as well but i think it should be encouraged as making anyone your support system. I believe by setting that mindset it is much easier to feel the pain of someone who may be experiencing something horrible even if they are across the world. We are one human kind and it should be a fight to end the climate crisis together, and making bonds with other countries/people to work against it is so crucial for success
<br><hr>
I think your comment sums up a lot of what I was thinking about while watching the movie. For starter, I’d never heard the Muhammad Ali quote before, but i completely agree with the message behind it. We owe it to the planet and those around us to look out and support others. What we give we can expect, and that's what we need to start focusing on as a nation. Another important thing I noticed about the UN’s 2019 happiest countries list is that they are in fact democratic socialist countries. We Americans invented Democracy for what it is today, but it's time to move into a new better system, and stop being stuck in the past. Ken put it best, Democratic socialist countries focus on the middle class, whereas our government focuses on 1%. Although we don’t need to rid the values of capitalism completely, we should shift our ways towards socialism. In addition to making people happier, it will significantly help the climate. The top countries on the happiness list produced 1/2-1/4 the number of carbon emissions per person then we did in the US. It's obvious that our necessity for bigger and better is a false dream that doesn’t increase happiness for anyone. In terms of living with others and having a closer relation to our families, I also agree with you to an extent. I think we do need support networks and people who we can open up to and be vulnerable with. After all, the movie does mention that we are social creatures and that this is a necessary component to maintain consistent happiness. However, I feel we often need time to ourselves too, and that's where the idea of meditation based on compassion and kindness struck me. In my opinion, the film’s section about meditation was the most moving to me. I think meditation is something I need to work on, and that many others should work on it too. Just clearing are thoughts and thinking about life, might get us to realize that our obsessions with stuff and status are unnecessary. Another good point the film makes is about “flow”. It explains that we need to focus more on self-growth and getting good at things that put us in the zone and take us away from our egos. Overall I think this is one of the best movies we’ve been assigned yet. It focuses on both personal growth and environmental growth and shows how they can go hand in hand.
<br><hr>
The happiest countries are Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and the Netherlands. The great irony like Ken says is that we are searching for materialistic happiness which results in embodied carbon emissions in the process of creation. Affordability like you mention in terms of opportunity brings happiness because of the ideology of equality behind it. To clarify, opportunity that is evenly extended to everyone will eliminate inequality with social hierarchies and classes. In America, this difference is prominent as not everyone has the equal opportunity for medical, education, and other essential aspects of life in terms of affordability. The idea of happiness was very intriguing in a way that it prompts me to reflect about my own life. In this film, the director examines the seemingly poor life of people in Kolta Slum, India specifically focusing on Monoji Sihng having happiness levels equivalent to Americans. This fact really tells us that financial means is not the answer to happiness as people in the present work to survive losing meaning behind life. I felt that people are slaves to undesirable jobs and even if they do get a good pay they forget what sincere joy feels like. Happiness is a recipe that is a mixture of many things instead of just materialism rather it has to do with meaning.

<br><hr>
I completely agree that the current generation of America is open to adopting a new lifestyle and American framework. I think if more people watched documentaries like this one, they could see that these values have been getting lost in past years and that it's an important time to integrate them back in a modern way. It makes sense that because our society now values material wealth and individualism to the point of lacking empathy for others, these reflect our carbon emissions -- as the more stuff, the more emissions. Maybe the secret truly is to take steps in our lives that, like you put it, give us a support system that puts healthy relationships at the forefront, as well as adopting a flow and finding things that give us joy in doing. 

 <br><br>

This documentary brought me to tears many times, because I was putting my own life's experience side by side to many of the people in the movie and realizing that I truly am not as happy as I could be. I think I need to go out of my way and my busy schedule to do things that truly do make me feel happy, because that's the kind of rewarding feeling I am most in need of. Going forward, I am going to try to start doing things that make ME truly happy, and try not to adopt what others are doing. I'm glad I watched this film, thank you Ken!

<br><hr>
Your comment makes a lot of sense and definitely gives good insight on the way our society perceives overall happiness.  I love how you began your comment with the Muhammad Ali quote, as it truly sheds light on the ways people should perceive their place here on Earth.  I believe that thinking about Earth as a valuable resource that should not be taken advantage of is the mindset one must have in order to protect it.  Like you said, the Muhammad Ali quote asserts that people should understand that their presence on Earth is only finite.  With that said, I think this will enable more people to look at Earth as a valuable resource and motivate them to want to do more good for the environment.  I think the biggest thing that stuck out to me in your comment was the insight you gave on the lack of support systems present in American society.  Before reading your comment, I never really acknowledged the dwindling support systems in our society.  It's unfortunate to think that the typical family unit that was once very strong in America is beginning to dwindle down to hardly nothing, leading to an increasing trend in overall unhappiness in America.  However, I believe that the typical "family" unit is now coming in different, more untraditional forms.  As observed in the film, many people are seeking support systems in living with other neighbors and friends.  Hopefully, these support systems will eventually have more influence in American society as many people are lacking the typical support system that is vital for human happiness.  Not only will this cause an increase in happiness, but also an increase in environmentally conscious lifestyles.
<br><hr>
Thank you for sharing that quote by Muhammad Ali; so many stories from the documentary Happy bring to life that quote. For example, Andy Wimmer, who used to be a bank and computer manager, has been a volunteer for 17 years at the Home for the Dying and Destitute, the first home opened by Mother Teresa. Wimmer’s anecdote of giving a dying man a glass of water as a symbolic act stuck with me because as he explained, it is such a simple act but still so important. Even the smallest and simplest acts of kindness have a profound impact, and the fulfillment we get from helping others can feed our own happiness. The families living in the cohousing system in Denmark is also a perfect microcosm representing Muhammad Ali’s quote. In these cohousing communities, tasks are divided so every community member contributes to the public good. For instance, every day, two different members are responsible for cooking the meals for the entire community. This frees up cooking, eating, and washing dishes for the rest of the days in the month, which people use to spend quality time with their children and other community members. Every member does their part to keep their cohousing society running, making serving others an inherent quality in these types of communities. Muhammad Ali’s quote shows how humans take for granted their lives and lifestyle. Many people are living on this earth without paying rent, or in other words without doing any good for others or any good for the whole earth. I think happiness has the power to make us less selfish because our own happiness is contingent on getting outside our own head and doing something for the greater good. 
 <br><br>

In response to Ken, I think adapting to the climate crisis can and will result in happier people and happier lifestyles. People who believe that adapting to the climate crisis will result in drab, restrictive lifestyles are not visionaries. They probably have not seen the thriving lifestyles prevalent in Scandinavian countries or are too stuck in their own old ways to see the beauty in their communal housing lifestyles. They cannot envision the fulfillment that comes from growing and eating non-toxic, healthy produce from their own backyard, how liberating it feels to stop feeling the need for new things, and how doing things to better the environment and health of the planet can make you feel fulfilled and happy. It is a shame that people who are too afraid of change or still do not see that money does not equate to happiness are stopping others from doing something for the greater good.

<br><hr>
I really like that quote and I feel like it is very relevant to our society now. A lot of people do things that will benefit them with little regard for its effects on the lives of others, and that quote is combating that by saying if you are on this earth, to earn your keep you should be serving others. Denmark for instance, with their co-houses are a prime example of everyone coming together to live and build.

this was my favorite lecture of the whole course!!! i'm really interested in happiness and the study of it, and it was very interesting to tie happiness into climate problems such as heating, energy use, etc. i don't think happiness has anything to do with money nor where you live, but a sense of community. i don't think that you can tie climate problems or emissions to happiness either even though Ken has a very valid point. not realizing that i had seen this film already, i watched it again and learned things that i did not catch onto before. my housemate is from Japan but is one of the happiest people i know. maybe because he is not overworked, or because he is a special breed. all of these problems tie into eachother...!

“Happy” was an excellent documentary that highlighted some of the most important and topical issues that many Americans face. While many of the people interviewed in the film mentioned that their greatest goal in life was to pursue happiness, Ken, the documentary, and the data all point out that Americans are actually much less happy on average than other global citizens, specifically residents of the nordic socialist countries that Ken mentions. Many political pundits reject the idea of bringing socialism to the United States, neglecting that the term is actually referring to the happy and successful countries in Northern Europe. 
 <br><br>

I thought that the documentary conveyed a powerful message by highlighting a number of different individual cases that all connected with the greater theme of happiness. The film started by pointing out common aspects of happiness that many of us are familiar with: the importance of strong interpersonal relationships with family and friends, or the usefulness of a hobby such as surfing. This first half of the film also emphasized that personal conditions and circumstances actually have a much smaller impact on our happiness than we think. The woman who suffered the accident with the truck was an excellent example of how cultivating positivity and joy is possible even in the face of harsh circumstances.
 <br><br>

The greatest takeaway I got from this film was the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of happiness. The filmmakers emphasize that extrinsic happiness derived from money, status, or image were all far less effective in actually keeping people happy. The three intrinsic sources of happiness were self-improvement, family and friends, and giving kindness to others. I think this list is powerful and encapsulates some of the most fundamental sources of joy in human life.
 <br><br>

 Self-improvement can also be related to a hobby, such as surfing. One of the ways I have been considering self-improvement is by relearning or exploring a skill that I have lost touch with. Playing a musical instrument such as the guitar can be a great source of self-improvement. It can also come from deeper sources, such as a spiritual desire to grow and embrace positive transformation. This is also related to the third source of happiness, service. Engaging with charity, giving, or any other act of compassion is an actively spiritual behavior. The documentary does a good job of pointing out that faith or religion are not necessarily indicators of happiness, but rather that they can be ways of organizing practice. The final source of happiness the film mentions comes from the love shared with family and friends. I believe that working towards happy, healthy relationships is one of the key ways to find balance, security, and community.

After watching the film "Happy" and the lecture Ken provided us with I was happy to see that there was a film designed to show the world that happiness does not come from materials. Growing up I was never one to be materialistic which was "weird" to people around me as I never desired the newest gadgets or expensive clothes rather I was happy with what I had. Growing up my family provided me with anything that I could need even if it was not too manageable at the time they made things work which is something I have always been thankful for. I grew up with the mentality that things do not bring you happiness but the people you are with and the things that you do with your life do bring happiness to you. I love living my life with these beliefs and watching this film this week made me realize that various people and civilizations around the world also live their lives with the same mentality. Having taken psychology before this course I was already aware of happiness and what affects it and how one could experience happiness and flow within their lives. It is true that genetics make up 50% of one's ability to be happy, but with that being said, half of your happiness is predetermined for you so why not alter the other half in order to make your life happy and great. 
 <br><br>

Having a big house, new car, fancy clothes, elaborate meals, and every new technological gadget one could think of does not mean that one is happy, not even in the slightest. It angers me that people, like Ariana Grande, can create public pieces that discuss material things and how they affect one's happiness. It is not true that people who believe money cannot buy happiness do not have enough money, it is true that no matter how much money one has it only leads to more greed. While there are special circumstances where people with vast wealth are happy living with almost nothing, donating their earnings to others, the majority of people with wealth are never happy with what they get only greedy for more and the newest thing. Watching this film in a way opened my eyes, even though they were pretty open to this topic, as I was able to actually see the happiness that these people experience  in their daily lives while watching how little they have and the conditions that they endure each day. People need to actively work on seeking personal happiness in their own ways rather than rely on materialistic items and money to bring them happiness. Happiness is not something that can be bought and sadly, a lot of people do believe that it is something that can be purchased as most things now-a-days can be bought. Just like climate change denial has been bought and spread throughout the world, happiness has become a commodity that people believe can be bought and spread, altered when they feel fit. Until the world realizes that money cannot buy happiness, especially countries like America and Japan, then our world will continue to feel down, lacking the true materials to happiness: laughter, social interactions, and community. We need to make an active change within the world to spread these ideas and let people know that their happiness cannot be bought and to be truly happy they need to accept their life and strive to make themselves feel happy any way they feel fit.

I have to say that I truly admire that you've been raised to have a less materialistic relationship with happiness. Not a lot of people can say that. I think that this is a really important lesson that should be taught to all people. The film "Happy" may have been one of my favorite films in this class yet. It speaks volumes about the importance of focusing on intrinsic values rather than extrinsic values and how that can make you substantially happier than any amount of money ever could. I found it really impactful to see people like Roy Blanchard and Ronaldo Fadul, who haven't had the means to buy an abundance of things, be so purely happy and fulfilled with their life. Seeing the joy that Roy gets from driving his boat on the swamp, or how Ronaldo uses surfing as a sort of meditation to reground him and his priorities was inspiring. It really reinforced one of the points in the film that money does not equal happiness. This idea, that money equals happiness is just a lie that society has drilled into us. The idea that we have to work our lives away in order to earn enough money to buy all the biggest and best things is toxic to our own happiness. Take Japan for example. As said in the film, Japan is ranked the least happy among wealthy nations and this is linked to their phenomena of "Karoshi". Karoshi is a term that Japan coined to describe those who literally work themselves to death. This exemplifies how forcing ourselves to be dedicated to working can have the complete opposite effect of what we intend. 

 <br><br>

If we reshape our view of happiness, it would not only be helping ourselves, but it would also be helping our environment. By coming to the understanding that buying stuff will not make us any happier, it can also help bring this consumerism lifestyle to a halt. I would argue to say that consumerism is a plague over our society and it comes at the price of our environment and the nature around us. The stuff that we buy is usually produced with the help of fossil fuels, which we all know are extremely harmful. If we were to come to the understanding that our happiness is more impacted by the relationships we hold and the good deeds we do rather than the materialistic parts of our life, our planet would be a lot better off. That said, when you look at how countries rank in terms of happiness, it was really no surprise to me that countries with smaller emission footprints were ranked much higher than the U.S at #19. Costa Rica, which is ranked #12, has a per-person emission footprint that's 1/7 the size of the average American's. At #7, Sweden emits 1/4 the amount of the U.S. Neither of these statistics are ludicrous conclusions. People in these countries focus more of their attention on promoting their intrinsic values, such as helping others, being with family, participating in the community, volunteering, etc., rather than trying to fill the void they feel in their lives with things they can buy. 

 <br><br>

In this class, I feel like many of the acts that we've been discussing to help lower our carbon footprints have always come at a cost to what makes us happy. Not in any hugely significant way, but more along the lines of sustainable habits being less convenient and comfortable, which for many makes it feel like a chore. But the findings presented in "Happy" gives us a solution that benefits both the environment and our own welfare. By redefining how we view happiness and what we allow to determine our happiness, it will also have a positive correlation of lowering our emissions footprint, which is a win for everyone.
<br><hr>

I agree, this film was truly inspiring and disproved many misconceptions that developed countries have regarding the developing countries. It's not any one person's fault, but linking materialism and monetary success to happiness are societal constructs that have been formed over generations. I found it interesting, yet not surprising, that although the amount of money that people are making recently has increased, levels of happiness have remained stagnant. Financial freedom does evoke a sense of relief, but it doesn't account for positive feelings alone. With that, capitalism contributes to a societal cycle of unfulfilled desires. With everyone competing to be the best, we "invest" our money into materials so that we may appear successful. Whether that's having the newest smartphone, owning a fancy car, or by wearing bourgeois brand names. While these materials do make us happy, it is temporary, and the cycle will begin again with the change of the season. 
 <br><br>


The purest forms of happiness or positive emotions come from the simplest activities. In the film, they showed surfers and had them explain what the practice meant to them. They explained that it was a way to get out of their head, just be with nature and play. We are human, we are social beings and we're really never too old to play. Hearing other communities in developing countries explain what they do to find peace and happiness completely undermines our misconception in America and other similar places. 
 <br><br>


I do believe that our pursuit for happiness is misguided. From childhood, we are exposed to the definition of success (and therefore, happiness) as making money and owning nice materials. This is nobody's fault, our values are just in the wrong places. I think that by redefining our values to be simpler, free of cost, and internal, we will ultimately save ourselves in the pursuit of happiness, where we can then save the planet.

<br><hr>
Although Happy isn’t a environmental film, it did get the message across that material objects aren’t the key to happiness and that it’s important to value the little things such as spending time with your family or doing things that make you genuinely happy. Growing up I was always hearing that money is the root of all evil and as I got older, I realized that was very true, money doesn’t necessarily bring you happiness but rather it just fills a void in a person’s life. This film was very good at recognizing the fact that in recent years people have become less and less happy with their lives, and its very true and I feel like the reason for that is because people are so focused on what others have and what they don’t have and try to fit by buying things that don’t bring them happiness but makes them fit in. It’s sad to see that Americans care more fitting in rather than trying to be happy and find inner peace for themselves.
<br><hr>

I too was happy that there was a movie made about materialism, and how happiness doesn’t have to be associated with the wealth or material goods one has. When I first started watching it, I was quite surprised to see that it wasn’t a movie about the environment, but as I continued watching it I saw how intertwined it is with the content we are learning in this class. Materialism and the search of the american dream after overshadows true happiness, and being content without these things. As the movie followed the lives of people around the world, it was amazing to see how they lived so carefree and unbothered with so little goods in their lives. One that especially struck out to me was the surfer who was very wise, and made me question my own future. He was so much happier than hundreds of successful and wealthy people I know, which really made me question the future I envision for myself and this climate.
 <br><br>
If all americans watched this and decided to revamp their lifestyles and the definition of the American Dream, then the climate crisis would definitely be slowed down, or even stopped. Material goods are unnecessary, and if we all stopped using these non-renewable goods to flash our wealth we would only benefit from both more happiness and a cleaner, better environment. Something in the movie that showed society slowly inching its way there was the government in Bhutan. It was super cool to see how the government tries to increase the national level of happiness, instead of Gross Domestic Product. If America did that, our lifestyle would be changed but for the better. This movie was amazing, with so many eye opening statistics and examples of different people who are so much happier than us with almost no material goods.

<br><hr>
It was both heartwarming and heartbreaking to watch this film. Like you mentioned, it made me happy to watch a film that highlighted the idea that happiness does not come from material things once our basic needs are met. On the other hand, it was hard to watch what some people had gone through/are going through, but heartwarming to see how happy they are through it all. It was so surprising to me that those in poorer regions were just as happy as the average American despite having so many more struggles. They truly know how to be thankful for what they do have and find value/joy/happiness in things most Americans take for granted. All of those that the documentary interviewed attributed much of their happiness to the company of the people around them (and now I really want to live in a co-housing community at some point haha). Americans have most definitely created a culture in which we believe that more material things will bring about more happiness, and that culture is only promoted by celebrities such as Ariana Grande and the Kardashians. Likewise, it was also surprising to find out that in spite of Japan’s economic success, its citizens are some of the least happy in the world and are literally working themselves to death. It’s such a common occurrence that they have a specific word for it - I don’t even know how to begin to describe how sad that is. Japan is constantly praised for its economic growth, technology, etc. that I never imagined that it’s citizens may actually not be happy. 
 <br><br>
As far as Ken’s video, it’s almost ironic in that trying to find happiness we are destroying the planet and making ourselves less happy; if we tried to help the planet and live more simplistic lives we would likely end up happier, as studies have shown. If the proof is right in front of us, then why is it so hard to make a change? Norweigen countries have proven the fact that less emissions does not mean less happiness. The 7 happiest countries in the world have citizens with emissions that are just a fraction of Americans’
 <br><br>
Beyond a certain point, more money will not bring more happiness. Ken attributed the reason for this to be less work, which honestly makes perfect sense, especially when you look at overworking as the source of the problems Japan experiences. Less work means more time with family and friends, which means more happiness. A slightly lower salary (and we’ve already proven more money does not mean more happiness), means less unnecessary shopping, fewer mansions, etc., which in turn means less harm to the Earth.


<br><hr>
I cannot agree with you more. Happiness has been associated with materialism in the modern society for a long time. While most people believe that money is the source of happiness, this documentary provides us with great evidences that show that the relationship between happy and materialism is weak. We are not necessarily happy because of our wealth, and there are so many things in the world that can bring us happiness. However, this concept is not accepted by many people. Although the film has mentioned that the portion of happiness that money bring us is small, many people still believe that the more income they have, the happier they will be, and therefore devote themselves into industry. The real happiness mostly come from our activities, and they are not always related to money. We can be happier without materialism.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said. The film "Happy" does a good job in introducing values of happiness for other cultures to Americans, and the western world. So much of our society is invested into stuff = wealth = happiness, that we forget that much of the world doesn't have the wealth or resources to have as many possessions as we do, and yet are still able to be happy. This film really embodies the saying of how all good things in life are free. Meaningful relationships and personal goals and achievements should be valued more than the consumer culture that is rampant in the US now.

I feel this film to be interesting and attractive to me while i am watching as i never see a film with the topic of happy. In this film, informations about happy are shown. Such as the happiness of different people, different kind of happiness and different level of happiness in different place and so on. This film gave out data of happiness. Like the compost of happiness: there are 50% of happiness level is determined by our gene which is called genetic set point, 10% determined by circumstances like job, money, social, and 40% determined by things that we can do on a regular basis to become happier. This conveys the idea that the circumstances take least influence on our happiness. I also learned that there are two main goal in value people pursue in life. Financial success which is money, the image which is good appearance and status which is popularity are three main extrinsic goal. The three main intrinsic goal are personal growth, close relationship with friends and loves and desire to help the world be better place. The extrinsic and intrinsic goal are stand at exact opposite side of value system. There’s a research in this film shows that people who have extrinsic value and oriented toward money have less satisfaction to life, more depressed and anxious. But those who focus on intrinsic value are more happy and less depression. The film also shows a graph which tells a trend that people’s happiness didn’t grow with the economic growth. Those are because when people have basic need met, more money doesn’t buy more happiness.
 <br><br>


Some examples of different people have different happy life are also shows in the film. Like a carter, he thinks he’s a rich man and live a happy life. He feels happy when he watch his children calling baba when he get home after work. He had close relationship with his friendly neighbors. Although sometimes he and his family only have rice with salt for dinner, he still feel happy. However, in Japan, there are many people die because they work too much and overwhelming stress. They work themselves to death. This toxic and unhappy lifestyle lead to the low level of happiness among Japanese. I feel really sorry when i saw the overwhelming work took away a little girl’s father’s life.

 <br><br>

For now, it’s a common phenomenon that people pursuing their happiness at the cost of our planet.  People exploiting the planet resources and harm the natural environment. Obviously they are pursuing extrinsic value. As this film told us, when most of us meet our basic need, those extrinsic value like money won’t make us happier. Larger houses, more cars, a pile of clothes won’t make us happier. Instead, excess pursuing material life would indirectly cause harm to our planet. Just like the harmful effect we just talked about in the first film.

At first while watching this film, I was unsure of how it connected to the environment or climate change, but I realized that the themes of this film connect greatly with the themes of the other films. For example, aerobic exercise is one of the greatest ways to release dopamine, which creates happiness. The “Being the Change” documentary shows that biking or walking rather than using cars is a great way to cut carbon emissions. Similarly, “Tomorrow: Demain” emphasizes that manual labor is very important in sustainability through microfarms and more environmentally friendly agriculture. “Happy” also includes growing produce manually in Okinawa and also conveys that this brings people together in the community and creates a family dynamic. Thus, exercise and work not only connect with living more sustainable lives, but also more happy and meaningful ones.
 <br><br>
Also, in “Happy” Andy Wimmer leaves his successful job at the bank to work at a home for the destitute in India and finds it far more fulfilling than the success and status from his previous work. This connects to the ideas in the minimalism documentary because many of them also decided to leave behind the jobs that did not bring them joy and make changes to bring them more happiness. The film mentions the “hedonic treadmill”, which is the idea that we are constantly dissatisfied with our current situation because we always want more, dubbing this the enemy of happiness. Leaving behind this need for more, whether it is more money or more material goods, is very effective in boosting happiness levels.
 <br><br>
I thought the part about Bhutan and this country deciding that gross national happiness is the responsibility of the government was very interesting. It makes sense because a happier country will be a better one and will probably also boost worth ethic, but most countries would not take on that responsibility; it is very admirable that a developing country is putting happiness above economic pursuit. This is very different than the Japanese, who focus on work and the economy so much that karoshi, death from overwork, has become very common.

I can thoroughly say that I genuinely, wholeheartedly loved watching this film. It didn’t even feel like I was doing homework or watching a film for an assignment, it really felt like I was just watching a documentary because of my own interest and wonder. It tackled so many interesting stories, and notions that I had never even heard of before, and some that I knew of before but never really gave much thought towards. Although this film had virtually nothing to do with climate change I feel like it is the most one that resonated with me pertaining to a desire to change my actions and behavior to better accommodate the climate, the planet and society as a whole around me. 
 <br><br>

One of the first things that I found extremely interesting is that 50% of your happiness is to do with your genes (your genetic set point or set range), 10% is to do with your circumstances (so your Job, your material possessions, your socio-economic status), and 40% is attributed to intentional activity, so actions that you choose to do. I found this extremely intriguing because often what is advertised to us by marketing companies, by politicians and by society in general is that maybe a good 80% of our happiness is derived by our circumstances. Living in this materialistic world, that is driven by consumption, capitalism, and the strive to always have more, we are always made to believe that more is better, and more will lead us to greater happiness, and therefore it is a continuous cycle of depression and striving for something that you can never achieve, and can never get, because an infinite amount of “stuff” and money is just never going to be attainable. 
 <br><br>

Another thing that really stood out to me was the happiness of the bush tribe in Namibia that were genuinely so happy and so content with their simple lives. I started to think how we are taught to believe in modern, industrialized societies that these people live uncivilized, uncultured lives, and that we should pity them, we should want to educate them, and want to civilize them. All while they are probably living happier lives than half the population of the US, they are content and jubilant where and how they live and in fact they would probably pity us, seeing the way we live such disconnected lives. We claim that technology and progression has brought us closer, made the world smaller, we are able to contact and communicate with people all around the world, yet some of us may never talk or have a meal or engage with our next door neighbors. WE NEED to take a second to slow down everything, slow down our thinking, our working, our technology and just focus on the small, important things in life: what will make us intrinsically happy.

I truly adored this film to the greatest extent. Definitely my favorite film in the entire course. Even though it wasn’t necessarily directed towards the environment, it definitely impacted my way of thinking. I love being happy, who doesn’t? This film basically gives you the secrets to happiness. If only more people in the world were able to see this film and get a better understanding of the true meaning of life, would this world be a better place. Happiness is good for many things,not just to make you feel good inside. I feel like happiness is like a lifestyle people live, not just something that comes and goes. I also see it as a positive feedback loop, because, “Happiness can actually help you get your other goals, have better relationships… do better at the job”, which in turn would lead to a greater level of happiness and proceed back through the loop. In the film, a person said that, “People are going to like you more if you’re happy”, which in my opinion I find highly debatable, because in our society, there’s always that one person that just can’t be happy for someone else that is happy. 
  <br><br>
I find the film very impactful, because it gives me the knowledge I need to achieve or at least strive for a happier lifestyle, which all I need to do is implement it. For example, when the film said that 40% of people’s happiness comes from intentional activities, it made me think more about what I could do to alter this category such as exercise. It was said that, “Any kind of physical activity is very important for a human being”, which I took highly into consideration.
 <br><br>
 The idea of the hedonic treadmill was then brought upon, which says that whatever level of wealth or material goods you have, you adapt to it and you’ll always want more. This is the main issue in today’s society whether that be on a microscopic or macroscopic scale, it always leads back to us wanting more, meaning more detrimental effects towards our planet. In the film it was said that, “The hedonic adaptation is one of the main enemies of happiness”, which I see why and agree with this statement. The studies that were done deduced that the happiest people all had close, supportive family and friends, which I find extremely true based on my personal life. This is definitely essential to all human beings. This is why people need to spend more time with family and friends as opposed to working. This is why mostly everyone in Denmark is happy; they spend less time at work and more time with friends and family. On the contrary, countries like Japan do not work like this. I almost cried when the film brought up the father from Japan that seemed exhausted, but still headed to work to provide for his family. It was heartbreaking to hear that he died at such a young age from heart failure. It was also sad to see that the parents were talking about whether the daughter could even recognize her father, because he was gone for so long because of work. This wasn’t how life was like just for this man, it was the entire country being worked to death. Everything about the scenes that depicted life in Japan was just so depressing, like something straight out of a horror film. How could people live in such harsh conditions?
 <br><br>
 I really admired the priorities of the small country of Bhutan. I love how the Government official of info and communication, Dasho stated that it was the government’s responsibility to maximize gross national happiness as opposed to gross national product. Denmark consistently ranks as the happiest country in the world as of the making of this film. They stated that co-housing plays a big role in this. I believe it’s because not only are you spending much more time with your family, but also with the friends that you meet along the way. As mentioned in the film, “...social bonding, social interaction, cooperation is programmed to be intrinsically rewarding to humans”, and I couldn’t agree more. We, as humans, need those types of interactions, because we are social creatures; we thrive off social interaction. Think about the people that love being around other people and interacting with them, as opposed to someone who is always isolated and introvertive (no shade). I can definitely say that I have been through both of these phases, but I’m currently in the former as opposed to the latter, which I love. A quote that I got from the comedian near the end of the film which I absolutely loved was that, “The best thing we can do for a child is to help them learn love”, which I 100% agree with. People would then learn to be happy. And also, “The trick is to be authentically you”.
 <br><br>
 Regarding Ken’s question at the beginning of his video: “Are we indeed destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness?” The answer is YES. This is probably one of the most obvious questions you’ve ever asked, because it’s so clear what the answer is after watching the film and from obtaining knowledge from other assignments from this course. This misguided pursuit of happiness in most societies around the world is the possessing of materialistic things, which in essence don’t make us happy at all, if anything, it’s doing the opposite.

This is a very personal thing, but when I was watching "Happy", I almost cried a few times when the section came up about the woman being ran over and how she had to go through some serious trauma to gain back true happiness in her life. I know that feeling all to well, as a personal event happened to me where I was hit by a car in my Junior Year of high school. I remember feeling so lost, so sad before the accident, I was not in a good mental state at the time before the accident, as life was hitting hard for me. But from what the narrator and the woman said that every sense of tragedy makes you even more happy and the devastation only lasts awhile is true. When I got hit by a car, I had faced one of the most devastating moments in my life, but I began to cherish my moments with my friend and family as my recovery time went on. I realized that life is way too short, and we need to use our times wisely to do the things that make us happy. But the most important thing is to truly cherish our time with the people and things we love, especially since we never know what bad events will happen to us.

 <br><br>

Even though Ken has stated that the film "Happy" is not an environmental film, the aspects of fixing climate change has all been there. From living a minimalistic lifestyle, to being part of co-housing, to biking and walking more often than just using a car, it is all there. Happiness may came from our actions to better ourselves, but we can make the environment and atmosphere filled with happiness, joy, and relaxation if we did the right things to take care of the planet. If we take care of Mother Earth, she will take care of us as well. This American lifestyle is not ideal, we are working and stressing ourselves down to the bone. And for what? For a paycheck? For unreasonable hours? For unfair and unequal social and economic class? For a car that is killing the planet? This is not a way to live, this is not true happiness. This is just an artificial flavoring of happiness.

Change is important to maintaining “the spice of life”, as according to the film ‘Happy’. I was thinking about this while watching the film, especially as this pertains to neurotransmitters and our behavior. Our concept of change in a positive sense is inherently tied to capitalism and consumerism, so untying things that produce happiness for us from those practices are very difficult. 

 <br><br>

As shown with multiple folks in the film, these little acts of change can be something as little as going a walk outside or as extreme as purchasing a McMansion. The difference that comes into play there is sustained happiness-inducing activities versus the temporary boost that comes with a purchase; by investing so deeply in the temporary highs of consumerism, we can participate in things that don’t necessarily require increasingly exorbitant monetary expenditures. 

 <br><br>

Happiness is not about what you have or your circumstances - in fact, that’s only contributing to about 10% of your happiness - but more about what you do to influence your own way of life. If you are able to get into what you do, feel as purpose, feel a passion, whatever it may be, that feeling of flow is more fulfilling than anything you can buy.

Happy was my favorite film of all. It just, just made me feel good about the world and my place in it. What I liked the most was that it showed that nice things don’t make us happy. People, communities, new skills do. And, consequently, these are all enormous positives to the environmental movement. Communities, I believe are what will create the grassroots movement needed to achieve true action on climate change. On the other hand, things that don’t make us happy, like wealth and things and arbitrary success, don’t make the planet too happy either. It’s time to start listening to what we actually want, not just what advertising tells us we want.
 <br><br>

I also enjoyed the overall theme of the film, which was that happiness is not as far away or complicated as it seems. While not easy, a large step towards happiness is recognizing what it is not. It is not, as our culture tells us, power, money, things, or fame. It is, on the other hand, doing what instinctively feels good: being with people, living in harmony with nature, simplifying your life.
 <br><br>

I’ve always had a sense that our culture complicates happiness too much. I remember, after breaking a vase with a ball, ten year old me mounting what felt like an air tight defense of my right to have fun over my parents’ right to own nice things. While I probably wasn’t too convincing, I was on to something: Stuff doesn’t make us as happy as we think it will. I only wish more people would realize this.

I remember reading in my high school psychology class that happiness and material wealth only have correlation up to a certain point. As long as an individual has enough to cover the essential necessities they need to survive, like sufficient food, water, etc, it doesn’t matter if they have enough to barely survive or are millionaires, they rate their happiness around the same level. “Happy” reminds the audience that happiness does not stem from material wealth. I grew up around the Los Gatos area where a large number of the occupants are of high status who own million to billion dollar houses. Watching this week’s film made me recall years ago when I was talking to a police officer who told me that his district (which is mainly the more affluent parts of Los Gatos) has the highest per capita of 5150 (danger to yourself or others) calls of anywhere in California. I also appreciate how “Happy” was able to present really interesting facts that I personally did not know beforehand. For example, I didn’t know 50% of what determines happiness is genes. Only so much is in our control to take take charge of our mindset to make ourselves “happier.”

I enjoyed watching this film SO much! I felt like I learned a lot about a fascinating topic, even outside of relation to the environment. The film does a great job of giving a variety of perspectives, information and stories. It was also incredibly exciting to me to learn about different aspects of different cultures and lifestyles. This is my favorite part of documentaries: they can offer a sociological peek into the lives of other peoples that I wouldn't be able to witness otherwise. However, I did also feel a lot of pain while watching this film -- during the segment on Japan and karoshi. It broke my heart to see the culture I grew up with, the immense pride that is at the core of Japanese society and leads to such an emphasis on working hard and contributing to society, spiral into an epidemic of suffering and loss of life. It didn't surprise me but still, I felt for the people interviewed and the country as a whole. The values that lend to this phenomenon are not bad, rather, I treasure them and take pride in how they've shaped an incredible nation and myself over time. But anything in excess is harmful. The values that make Americans arguably the worst contributor to this crisis are not necessarily negative, and I think that is important to remember. Wanting a better life, wanting hard work recognized, wanting to give your children the tools and things for which they will be the most happy -- these are all fine. The problem is how Americans have been told to reach these ideals: through buying more and more, accumulating money, pushing other people down with no regards for consequences and human decency. This is why I think this film is so important to watch. It addresses the misconceptions of how these actions and ideal correlate or don't correlate 
 <br><br>

The part that stood out the most to me was when the man who worked in the sick and elderly housing. He said, "My life is like a loan from God. I will give the loan back, but with interest." This quote has been on my mind since I watched the film and I honestly really love it. Regardless of religious affiliation or belief in a God, this concept of not letting the gift of life result in net zero happiness for others is so important. I was inspired after the film to take control of the things I can, seek opportunities  to "flow" and overall take agency for my life and my feelings. I think that fighting the fight against climate change is a example of accumulating interest with your life. The things we do as a generation, as a class, as individuals will either leave a positive net sum for our children and grandchildren, or the opposite.

This is the third time that I watched this film, and I love it very much. I would like to say that this film is composed of small stories which are absolutely very touching and thought-provoking. The story of Moody is especially influencing me because I am a girl too and she is such a strong and positive woman. She is such a woman who has such an outstanding exterior but had an accident that destroyed her beautiful faces. However, she found a more valuable way of living, and make herself more beautiful than ever. I really am inspired and respect this powerful woman.
 <br><br>

I remember the first time I watched it is on the English22 course. At that time, there were no Ken’s video explaining why he chose this film and what are the ideas in this film that are related in this class, so I was guessing that it will be that increasing the intrinsic value will help us be a better and happier person while making contributions towards solving environmental problems. This is the advantage of English 23 that, through the extra video, we get to see deeper with the help of teacher’s information. Ken compares the level of happiness in America with other countries. The conclusion is that we don’t need to consume that much to be happier. In fact, the less we consume and demand, the more we found in the intrinsic value, so I think the example that Ken used is very precise, comprehensible, and compelling. This film has also examined one of the things that Ken has taught in this class that living a more environmentally friendly life doesn’t mean you have to give up a lot of things and lose the happiness you gained from them. On the contrary, you are just changing a way of living and gain a new kind of happiness and proudness.

I really loved the film Happy and found it honestly a little sad. I feel like many of us place so much emphasis on minute and unimportant things in hopes of becoming happy. As if once we get everything we have ever dreamed of, we will finally be content. This reminds me of the Jim Carrey quote mentioned previously in the course, “I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer.” It sounds almost obvious to say that money and clothes and all the items you seek will not truly make you happy, assuming you make the certain amount of income where money will not contribute anymore. And deep down I think we all know it, but I can never understand why we continue to rely on the ways that can honestly make us less happy, as our primary outlet for joy and fulfillment. I also fall victim to the societal pressures of always wanting more than I have, and assuming it will add real value to my life. Watching this video showed me that our idea of happiness is backwards and we have been taught to search for it in the wrong places. The man in India who drove a rickshaw as his primary way of income, was found to be just as happy as the average American. Initially, this shocked me. The average American has a completely different, higher standard of living. How could he possibly be just as happy? That example was all it took to show me that what we have materialistically means nothing and contributes nothing to how happy we are, and we are too focused on the wrong things to make us happy. This man found happiness in his child, his family, his neighbors, in people. Again, it seems obvious, but it really isn’t and it does make me sad. There are so many other ways to find joy in life, starting with the amazing people there are on this planet. If we put half as much energy into seeking out what really makes us happy, such as surfing like the man in Brazil or the man who sailed on the lake, as we did into buying and spending, I think our lives would change drastically. It is not to say we do not already have people, hobbies, etc to make us happy, but we suddenly forget about them and lose sight of it when our attention is focused on less important things. This is a tough subject to crack, especially for those of us who have been living an average American lifestyle their whole lives. We do not know anything different, and it’s hard to transition away from habits we did not even think twice about until now. There is an obvious disconnect between Americans and our happiness, and I think the best way to start is to find what makes you genuinely happy that does not involve wanting more. Be happy with what you have and the things around you.

I am very thankful to have watched this film. 
 <br><br>
It’s so crazy to me how easily I can get sucked into a false idea of happiness on a daily basis. With social media today, for me (as well as probably every other teenager), it is so easy to get sucked into a false idea of happiness. By being exposed to so much social media all the time, I can get sucked into thinking about other lives too much and not taking care of mine. Instead of doing push-ups and working on myself and helping others, I can get too caught up in just thinking and wishing about these other lives that people have and how I can attain this perceived happiness I see from it. 
 <br><br>
This film was just a great refresher for me and what makes me happy. The film showed how we are social creatures, and much of our happiness comes from the sense of community we have with others. I really liked the example of the people of Okinawa, and how healthy and happy they are. Clearly, unlike modern Japan and the problem of Karoshi - overworking, the people of Okinawa are connected to each other and find time in every day to find joy in each others company. I really like the sense of community and the example of how all of their ashes are buried together - showing that they are one family. 
 <br><br>
For me, this movie is a call to action for me to enjoy all of the beautiful blessings and friends that I have. I am finding happiness in being myself and being with others - laughing, caring, showing my love to them. I am grateful for my life and that I get to share it with others, and I will do my best to spread happiness.




</p><hr>


<p>
Watching this film reminded me of the beginning of this class, where we studied the problems with society and why materialistic people are more depressed because there’s always something better out there, and people of modern society feel as if they’re lesser beings if they have less material things than the people around them. 
 <br><br>
It was frightening watching the scene in Japan, where they start off asking the business man what he was doing for his birthday. He replied that his girlfriend had invited her to celebrate but “he would see her tomorrow”. It’s really what we’re coming to. Putting off personal, internal happiness to go to work and earn money because having loads of money is viewed as equivalent to being happy. It’s frightening knowing that you’re being raised in a society that values material success and it’s hard to imagine being in a society that valued personal mind and soul happiness instead. It’s so sad. It feels as if it would take a miracle to make it work, yet the film shows us how other countries do it. What is keeping us from doing it? It’d be easy to chase after true happiness if we weren’t outcasted for doing so in our society. 
 <br><br>
What I took away from this film is to be happy and make the most out of what I have. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side, it’ll be greener wherever I water it.

As the last film for the quarter, I thought Happy was the perfect choice. It didn’t even mention the climate crisis and yet with the context of the last nine weeks of class, we don’t need the film to give us that context. I loved the various segments of the film, two of my favorite being some of the most vulnerable moments, such as the woman in Japan talking about her late husband. The home video showing him arrive home from work and their cute little daughter running to him, and giving him a teddy bear so that they could play— it’s just heartbreaking. The other segment about the mother who, after an accident, was hospitalized and her life was never the same again, that was just as empowering in the sense that she became stronger even though she almost lost everything. She even found new love. Regarding the climate crisis, I do think people will be happier on the other side of change. Project Drawdown kind of makes it that way. Smaller housing will bring people closer together, and improving the public transportation system will make people happier in the sense that it’s reliable and fast and they’re able to work and come home and see their families. Just like Ken said with Sweden, there will always be problems but on a greater scale, people will be happier. Rich and luxurious people, I don’t know if I can speak for them; they have seen the world and done everything, though as we have seen in the documentaries, some of them realize that it isn’t really everything. In the end, we don’t have a choice. Everyone and the Earth will suffer if we don’t do anything, so the only choice is to follow the Green New Deal (with low income people and minorities in mind) and after the transition, we’ll be happier. The transition part might be rough but we always adapt, especially if it’s for the good.

Seeing the contrast between the life I live and the lives of those living in other countries was both eyeopening and interesting as they are so incredibly vastly different! Luxuries and material can certainly bring happiness, that I do not disagree with. But they are not necessary, and some of my happiest memories are from experiences with people I love, or achievements I've made, etc. Many of the material items that bring me happiness are tied to an experience or person, like the jade bangle I wear was gifted to me by my grandmother. It's insane that even when people reach financial success, it is not enough. There is more to gain despite having enough, people want more and it seems the rich still cannot be satisfied despite having beach houses in foreign countries, strips of mansions, ten cars, etc. Materialism creates an illusion of happiness. Happiness can be so different for everyone. The same joy I would feel finding a dollar on the street would be nothing to a millionaire. 

 <br><br>

My family immigrated to the United States and I'm a first generation student. I've been told my entire life to work hard so I can live comfortably and take care of my family. That is part of my definition of success, to be comfortable enough to care for my family. I've come to realize that although money is very important to me and my family's happiness, it isn't everything. The workaholic culture in America makes it difficult to widen my vision outside of my goal of money, but I'm trying to learn how to pursue happiness in other ways. For example, I grew up wanting to work as a lawyer or doctor, because my family pushed for it knowing they were well paying jobs. Coming into college, I went through a crisis of not really knowing what I wanted to do with myself because I realized it wasn't what I wanted for myself. I knew I wouldn't be happy. Now I'm pursuing a communications career and I couldn't be happier! It's important to determine what happiness is for yourself and set parameters.

Awesome perspective! I too was compelled by how "Happy" depicted the glaring contrast of lifestyle and culture of other countries with that of what we commonly recognize as the American way of life. Lifestyle and culture synonymous with the "American Dream" aspirations have captivated and permeated all of Western society (and beyond) in one way or another. "Happy" effectively refutes our familiar, and often contorted objective of happiness and prosperity, marked by excess materialism/consumerism, luxury, and "the bigger the better" attitude. I also found it interesting (and like Ken mentioned in his video) how we so often hear of stories of how even rich, self-made, and successful people -- who might seem to have pursued and captured happiness and prosperity -- do not feel fulfillment because they continue seeking for more without recognizing that they have all they need. I find it very disheartening that we find ourselves striving for the same things even though we are told that it may not be true; we have so accustomed to associating fiscal and material gain with happiness and fulfillment.

 <br><br>

I really appreciated your closing paragraph, as I think it was something that we all need to recognize and come back to as much as possible, especially as college students in a day in age when we are constantly pressed with decisions about our future. I too want to start reminding my self to replace “how can I make more money?” with “what can I do which will make life more meaningful to me?”. In the end, I think the Western culture and lifestyle will continue to be one of the hardest roadblocks we have with the climate crisis, but I am ever more hopeful as more and more people are starting to live happily against the common grain.

I really enjoyed the documentary Happy. It is always refreshing to see how other people live in other countries and seeing their values and what brings them happiness. While there were quite a bit of differences there is one thing that seemed to be constant which was family. This was not surprising to me but it did make me happy to hear. I have a huge family who is the best support system i could ask for. We spend every holiday together and it makes me happy that other people around the world are valuing such time no matter the occasion. But when reflecting on this it made me realize my privilege, and how not everyone has this picture family behind them. As well as the privilege I have of being an American. American values lay deeply rooted in fossil fuels which creates obvious problems, unnecessary at that. While America is 19th happiest country i truly believe if we eliminated fossil fuels we would be in the top 5 happiest countries. America’s pursuit of happiness needs to be drastically changed. Overall I thought this was a great film and it really opened my eyes, I would recommend this to everyone.

This film gave me a new outlook on life. It showed me just how messed up our society has become. We are told that working until we are at the top and have millions of dollars that we will never be truly happy. When it's actually the opposite. People are working themselves to death and very few are actually happy. I know that in the future I don't want to work extreme hours and have no time for myself. My dad works 90 hours a week sometimes and I know that he isn't as happy as he could be. I wish he would work less and make time for himself. 
 <br><br>
This quarter I have started making more time for myself and I have seen improvements in my happiness. Instead of waiting until the last minute I get stuff done earlier. It gives me more time to sleep and I have more time to hang out with my friends. My grades are better because I'm not rushing to finish assignments. I also changed my major because my classes were causing too much stress and anxiety.

This film brought me to a moment of realization. Although, yes, our brain functions control a percentage of our happiness many other factors tie into it, too. Sometimes I think that it is impossible to change my mood, but obviously there are things I can do to improve it and I think that fighting for the climate may help me do that. On top of fighting for the climate, in the future when it is (hopefully) better I believe that humans will be generally a more joyous species. I think that before we go straight into fixing the climate for happiness we need to fix our way of working. Referring to the film, people have literally been working themselves to death. For what? A CEO that does not know their name? Yes, I know that obviously to be able to live a sustainable life you must make money, but it should not be at the point it is at. I think happiness from a society will come from being treated like a person instead of a chess piece. We are not here for people to strategically use, we are here for love and compassion. I think that once we achieve a better lifestyle the environment will begin to play out for itself (with a little help). Happiness is such an important part of life and it is something we put little importance on.

When I first saw that we were assigned a film called "Happy," I thought it was going to debunk the American Dream myth of happiness (that happiness can only be achieved by having more material wealth even if that is at the expense of everything else including family, friends, health, hobbies, and even morals and values) and would then go into talking about how various Western environmentalists were living self-reported happier lives than the average American. I was happy (no pun intended) to be mistaken. Even though the documentary didn't talk about the climate crisis directly, it was apparently clear to me throughout the film why Ken assigned it to us. I've always been really frustrated by the people who say that they believe climate change is real and it poses a real threat to life on earth but that our dependence on fossil fuels is necessary for the kind of modern life we've made for ourselves--a life of happiness. I knew intrinsically that they were wrong, I just couldn't put it into words so I was stuck in a state of frustration where I was angry with them but couldn't tell them why. That's why I think this film is so important to include in this course's content. Watching this film and Ken's accompanying lecture has given me the words to explain to people who make the previous argument why they are wrong in an intelligible and research-backed way. I also appreciated how this film used scientific research about psychology and the brain to back up what the happy people in the film were saying. I also really, really loved how the film looked at people from around the world and explored many different cultures. This really adds to the film's credibility and reliability to the widest audience possible--something that is also very important when convincing people that we can lead happy lives that don't destroy that planet. Since this class is (hopefully) teaching a generation of students how to be climate activists in their personal lives, their communities, and their governments/countries, it is essential to understand how to combat the argument of happiness coming from fossil fuels and instead advance the truth that we don't need to rely on fossil fuels to be perfectly happy and fulfilled.

After watching this week’s film “Happy,” I have a brand new idea about happiness. From the film, it says that half of out happiness determined by our genetics, and only ten percent of our happiness is determined by how much money we possessed, or what kind of job we are working with. This is completely different from what I used to believe. In the past, I used to think that with more money, people are happier. However, given by this data, I found that with more money doesn’t mean that the one is happier. Furthermore, to achieve the greatest happiness, we need to be mentally heathy, and this is the part ignored by most of us. Job and money are just physical part. Mental problems like pressure and so on can be detrimental to our happiness. Therefore, if we ignore mental health, we wouldn’t be happy at all.

I really enjoyed this film and it was very eye opening for me. I know the US emits a lot of carbon and is not highly ranked in terms of happiness but I did not know to what extent this was happening. What really shocked me was the comparison between average citizen's wealth in these countries. The fact that Costa Ricans emit 1/7 of what the average American emits while being 7 places happier in the rankings say a lot to how our consumer culture is bad for ourselves as well as the world. 
 <br><br>
One part of the video that specifically stood out to me was the part about Japan and the happiness there. I have been to both mainland Japan as well as Okinawa and there truly is a noticeable difference in the culture there. Tokyo seems to be always busy and everyone seems to be preoccupied and in a hurry. This can easily lead to a more stressed lifestyle but in Okinawa I met some of the most friendly and relaxed people I have ever known. I met an old udon shop owner who invited me and my friend to his house to eat, drink, and watch the sunset as that is what they do for fun. He lived a simple but happy life, being appreciative of the beautiful view he had on the island. I think about his life from time to time and just how different it is from my life and the lives of my parents and how he is still happy even with less. This really shows the point of the film on how we should work to be happy instead of for money or fame or any other of the extrinsic goals.

Out of all the things presented in Happy, meditation was the most interesting to me. I had always viewed it as this sort of snake oil practice and never really gave it much credit. After the scientific exposition of the film, I looked up several articles, including some conducted at Harvard university which outlined a clear correlation between happiness and meditation. What was interesting to me was the fact that it was observable happiness. This wasn't some random half-baked survey where people rated their happiness but rather they were batteries of MRI's,  all showing increases in dopamine and changes in brain composition like the film presented. 

 <br><br>

Whether or not there is any evidence that the correlation between the increase in Carbon emissions and the decrease in happiness is the causation of the climate climate crisis, I like this approach more. I like pondering at what led us to this and what we can do to get out. The direct approaches to climate change we have been dealing with have been preached for over three decades now and still we have the majority of the population in denial or inaction. We need a new way to promote change and this new left field approach of looking for correlations between our actions and the climate might just spark an answer that motivates the general population. Overall, this might be my second favorite piece in this class, only second to DiCaprio's film. I enjoyed thinking about the problem in a new way and enjoyed the optimism embedded in this film.

The movie really speaks to me because I feel like its the life I've been trying to live recently. I comment about how I used to live in Denmark for a year almost every week but its because it really changed the way I see things. I learned first hand how happy the people really are there. My dad likes to bash on the Danes because they are socialist and he's a conservative and I can argue with him all day about the pros and cons of socialism and capitalism but in the end its always just so easy to say that people are happier in Denmark so obviously they're doing something that we are not. I witnessed first hand what community living is like. Its more economical, it makes people happier and gives them a sense of belonging, which is important because humans are social beings, and most importantly it's a more sustainable way to live. I took a danish architecture class where learned about how two of the most important things they keep in mind when building housing is its impact on the well being of the citizens and it's environmental impact, which is why there are no high rises in Copenhagen, they impact the environment and the citizens negatively. I know that when I graduate in June I won't be ready to live alone. Community living seems like a great way to live and I want to find something like it. Valuing happiness over everything else seems like such a simple solution to almost all the problems that we as a society face today.

I really enjoyed watching this film and it made me think a lot about where I truly find my happiness. It was really inspiring and interesting to see all these people who materialistically had so little and lived such simple lives be so happy and content with their lives. One of my favorite people in the film was the surfer, Ronaldo Fadul, who just  lived his life doing what he himself wanted to do. He spends his days doing what he loves and urges others to do that too. He mentioned that everyone has something they want to be, whether that's a surgeon or a surfer, and you can work to “live your life in tranquility”. This was important to hear because we all get so caught up in the stress of school and work and what we need to do to get where we want to be in life that it often disrupts the tranquility in our lives. Fadul is saying, and I agree, that we all must try and instead work towards a goal of tranquility, not increased stress and pressure and this will look different for each individual.
 <br><br>
The biggest thing I got out of this documentary was the idea that doing things for and with other people has an immense amount of value and adds happiness to your own life as well as the lives of others. Whenever I’m feeling down or upset about something (like  how helpless I feel when it comes to climate change), my dad always tells me to go to something for someone. He tells me to buy someone a coffee or do them a favor and it will make me feel better. This is similar to what the man who worked in the house for dying people was saying. I liked what he said about how we are all given a loan in life and it is important to pay that back with interest, meaning to spread that “loan” to the people around you and positively impact other people’s lives. 
 <br><br>
Compassion and care is something I try to work on and improve in myself. I have noticed that with more compassion for others, you have less envy and jealousy and anger towards people, therefore establishing more inner peace within yourself, which radiates and spreads to the people you surround yourself with. If everyone were to practice more compassion and kindness, our planet would be a much happier and healthier place. 
 <br><br>
Happier people means a happier planet and a happier planet means happier people. Once we are able to break free of this extremely capitalist, profit-driven, consumerist system we currently live in, we can enter into a much happier, compassionate and connected planet.

I think that you're the last message is especially powerful, that fact that our society and our government prioritize money rather than securing the people's the basic necessities that will be affected if the nothing is done to address the destructive progression of the climate crisis that is being caused by our own actions is concerning, to say the least. Rather than not having a sense of security what so ever, our society implements fictional ideologies that success and wealth will somehow fill us. However, this is all make-believe meant to drive people to put in years' worth of labor to gain a large check and send it all in materialistic things thereby being labeled by society as successful and complete. However, a label is nice to achieve but after a second or two the realization that this label is worth nothing but affects the person more than bring them happiness as they were lead to believe. In my opinion, I am not sure if we are ever going to be capable of freeing ourselves from a capitalist system but things may change in the future that might help see this as a possible solution to our global issue.

I enjoyed reading your comment. The film also made me think about where I truly find my happiness. Being a college student can be stressful and often times we get too caught up with what's going on around us that we forget to ask ourselves this question, what brings us happiness? When watching the film I couldn't help but thin that the saying "money buys happiness" is not true. Many people, like showed in this film, have very little material things and still manage to live a healthy and happy life. In our society however we prioritize money. We are told that in order for us to live a happy life we need the biggest house, nicest cars, and a really good paying job in order to afford these luxuries. However these people who engrave these things into our minds at a young age fail to tell us that these luxuries don't guarantee happiness. I agree with you that we need to focus on the little things that make us happy which will then lead us to have a more peaceful and tranquil life.

That's a powerful message. Watching "Happy" made me think about why i have chosen to pursue the things that I do. I have found that while I am generally a happy person, I do sometimes feel discontent with my current situation. "Happy" has given me an explanation as to why I feel the way I do and how I can remedy it. I think giving back to my community and my friends and family can do leagues for my own personal happiness as well as the happiness of the people around me. When I was in high school, I used to do a lot of community service and charity work. Since coming to college, I've since stopped participating in these activities, and as a result, have noticed a severe lack of something that used to make me happy. Now that I understand this, I will seriously consider making some significant life changes to make myself and the people around me happier. I never considered material goods as a means to make myself happy, but I did find that some things were a decent means to making me happy. Despite this, I do have to agree that many people buy things to try to make themselves happier people. I hope to see myself and the people around me happier.

The film "Happy" was really interesting to watch especially after having taken AP psychology in high school so many of the same topics were discussed. This film pushes to show viewers how the real happiness that we strive to achieve does not necessarily come guaranteed when achieving wealth and success at an important job, rather it comes from much smaller an simpler things like family and being caught in states of flow. A really powerful moment in the film that nearly brought tears to my eyes was the scene in which the poor Indian man who works long days literally pulling people around in a cart with nothing but his physical strength and a wagon explains that although his work is tough he makes the best out of it and that he is truly happy because of his family he gets to see every evening along with the strong friendships he has with his neighbors and community as a whole. They may live in a fragile, tarp-covered shack, but they can full-heartedly answer that they are happy because of the loving positive atmosphere around them. Even successful Japanese businessman don't enjoy this type of happiness as their stress levels are constantly through the roof always placing work as the top priority and eventually leads to them simply dying from their own work, making people question the purpose of even working if you are unable to even enjoy the life it provides you and kills you while doing so.
 <br><br>


Nonetheless, these explanations of true happiness relate to climate change in that it goes to show we don't need a booming economy that is constantly producing greenhouse gases when its products don't even give us a true sensation of happiness. The fast fashion styles and buying huge houses produce short term happiness and people with these possessions still may struggle to feel the same joy as a person who lives in a shack since they are surrounded by family and friends. If our society as a whole learns that money and possessions don’t really equate to happiness not only would our society be better off but our climate would as well, with less demand for factory-produced goods.

I completely agree with your comment. Even before watching this week’s film, “Happy,” I’ve always made a point to live my life in a way that avoids deriving happiness from materialism by  instead looking for unique experiences, activities, and ways to make memories that will bring me more joy any store-bought item can provide. The contrasting ideas of happiness in the developed and undeveloped world really show the differences prioritization between different countries. In the United States and similarly developed nations, happiness is thought to be attained through owning the largest house and buying the most “stuff.” Whereas in India, as shown through the clip you mentioned about the Indian man, happiness is derived from providing for one’s family and community. This selfless approach to life and happiness is something I find deeply inspiring. 

 <br><br>

Part of transitioning to a greener economy needs to be derived from societal change. We cannot expect the government to place restrictions on fast fashion, cars, and other detrimental businesses if we’re not willing to live simpler lifestyles free from wanting everything in excess.

After watching this film, I asked myself Are you happy to live in your current life? My answer was not so sure. I am an international student who lives far away from home, China. In the past few months, my country, my family were suffering from the coronavirus. I was in a mood of depression during the past few months I believe. My country shut down all the stores, life facilities, and all the companies, restaurants were impacted greatly. People all said China was over. The economy was over in China. I was hesitating to believe in that way since my true happiness is to see my country prosperous all the time. Hence, almost all of the international students got together, searching for the n95 masks, and sent those supplies back to China to support our countries. I am glad to see how China now is going to be reborn in the following spring. I am happy now because my country has the strongest team, the people, the most professional medical teams, to work together, to save our country. Within the past two months, people were not allowed to go out. The air became fresher, the roads became cleaner. People were taking huge responsibilities for our country, so I can’t describe how happy I am right now.

The story in the Happy documentary is very inspiring and healing to me as I have seen so many awful events, and the endangering environment. What this movie gives me is the power to keep exploring the world and have faith for the future. It is not like the other movies that I have watched and talk about the general concept of climate change but this one presents me with a different point to deal with not only climate change problems but also any other adversities I have or will have. The power of happiness is so important that it becomes the basis of our routine life. After watching the Happy, I feel like I am not just living for the grand goals that either someone else or I set for me but I am living for the sake of happiness and I am more motivated and open now because I realize that happiness could deal with any problems and drive me to whatever I want. 
 <br><br>

The movie talks about that compassion, kindness and close relationship can all bring happiness to people. This is no doubt that it is true with all the examples Happy gives. People growing up in a family which has close relationship with each other tend to be happier and react to adversities in a more positive way. Also, when people are trying to be kind and grow compassion about certain things, they act more friendly and will be happier than others. I see locals in Namibia and slums in India who have poor life conditions but live happily with one and other. And I also see elders in Louisianan support each other and enjoy the moment. I also have people in Okinawan who are not family by nature or law but still act like family and are supportive to each other. I am convinced by Happy that no more materialism is needed to be happier. So, if happiness is our goal and it weighs much more than other ones, it is the time to re-examine and change our current lifestyle to move toward gaining happiness. As the video says approaching the end, we can gain happiness by doing little things that are free and near us. So why not? I can believe no more that when we all trace happiness, the world will become better and be full of enjoyment contributed by all of us. 
 <br><br>

If we are happy enough, we will not think about having more materials. If everyone who has 50,000 dollars is aware that they are as happy as those with 500,000 dollars, they will not chase for more consumption that will eventually hurts everyone else and the environment. So, I am grateful that I have the chance to watch this movie and really understand what I should go for but not for what others tell me and I want more people to notice that happiness is the priority but not consumption and wastefulness.

I really enjoyed watching the documentary “Happy” and seeing how happiness around the world differs so greatly in so many different cultures. To simplify life to the things that you are truly interacting with and that you can have in front of you, such as families and friends, allows us to create and maintain happiness. In order to transfer this culture of happiness to Earth, we have to be willing to understand that there are things in life we can and can’t control. We control everything that is changing the planet's climate that we shouldn’t feel upset and powerless that we can do anything. IT may seem like this because we believe we can do things small scale, but we can. This film guided me to this feeling once again so I thank Ken for this video and bringing it into my life. There is a reason that those who are truly happiest in life live get their happiness from the relationships that are truly involved with their lives, not the ones that could be. We need to move away from the things that keep us happy momentarially and move to something that is lasting for each person. 
<br><br>
For me, surfing recently became something that is a new way to find happiness in life. This only happened because someone close to me introduced it, so it goes to show that those who are close to you in life can provide guidance to happiness for you. Everyone should find that person who helps guides them to happiness because we can only do so much on our own. Not to mention and outside prospective gives us to see the side of our lives that we have a hard time understanding.

I completely agree with your comment and the insight you provided on how to achieve true happiness, such as living minimally, focusing on our close relationships, gaining outside perspectives, and finding free hobbies that make us feel happier longer than the temporary high of shopping ever can. The film, “Happy”, really opened my eyes to the importance of simplifying life in order to journey towards optimal happiness. This outside perspective is so helpful. I feel like most people correlate greater happiness with more things; in the U.S. especially, I hear people sharing that their next new car, home, or designer bag purchase will improve their wellbeing. However, the truth is that this cycle of consumerism not only damages our planet with unnecessary emissions but leaves us wanting more.

<br><br>

In the video, Ken stated, “The greatest irony, is that many of our pursuits are destroying it”. Personally, I have started learning to skate with my friends. Chasing a goal and spending quality time with others has left me much more content for longer than buying useless tops at Forever 21. Realigning our tactics to feel better can simultaneously aid us in lowering our footprint.

The film "Happy" was very effective in conveying that more money, material goods, and success does not necessarily mean happiness by showing interviews with various people across the world on how they achieved happiness in non-material ways. In a way, this film is similar to a previous film we’ve watched, Minimalism because it promotes lifestyles that do not require excess material goods or money. I find it truly ironic that we are destroying our planet in our misguided pursuit of happiness. I also found it interesting to hear that the average American has the same level of happiness as a person living below poverty in third world countries despite having access to so much more resources.

<br><br>

I liked this film because it conveyed that there is so much more to life than the pursuit of wealth and success. I found it depressing that there are people out there (e.g. Japanese workers) who would work themselves to death for money. I feel like there is too much pressure in society to find happiness via money, and I feel like it is a very toxic mentality to have. The film explains various ways to increase happiness, such as spending quality time with your loved ones and meditation.

I thoroughly enjoyed this week’s film, Happy. I thought the point it made about many people being happy despite not having a great job, or less than ideal living conditions, or even people who have had horrific accidents was both uplifting and inspirational. I especially loved the woman who had a car run her over and lost most of her face. She seemed so genuinely happy and grateful that it really had an effect on me. It was particularly uplifting to see because she had lost a part of her identity(her looks), had been abused, divorced, and gone through so so much and yet, she still found joy and happiness in the simple things. I don’t know if I would’ve reacted the same way after dealing with all that she had, but she was definitely an inspiration and someone I was incredibly happy for. 
<br><br>
I think a large part of life is what we make of it. It’s how we react to the ups and downs but also how we decide to live life in every moment. I loved how the psychologists discussed how the things that happen to us don’t actually make us happy or sad for too long. It’s more about our mindset and how we live moment to moment. It reminded me a lot of the last film we watched about meditation. I think by living in the present, allowing yourself to decompress, and finding time for yourself is so important to our mental health.

After viewing this film, I found my favorite word "happiness" became the greatest irony word. Do our happiness build on the destruction of our planet. We buy new cars, big houses, expensive clothes that are made of animals' fur. America has the most demand for cars in this world, but why is the average happiness in a country like: Finland...In those countries, they have better child care, insurance, and their college education is free. And their average working hours is lower than the US.That's something we have to ask ourselves. What is the real happiness in this world. Actually we can find happiness without spending money or release pollution to the earth.

Ironically, the Film "Happy" made me feel sad. In such a progressive society with multitudes of things, luxuries, and ways of connecting with others, people in the United States (at least in my opinion) don't seem as happy as they should. Take my brother for example. He is in his late 20's and has a job that pays him around 70 thousand a year, yet he tells me at times that he doesn't feel satisfied in his life. As a result, he takes on traveling as a means of momentary happiness. In contrast, something that makes me considerably happy is arts and crafts or DIY projects that are relatively inexpensive and quite fun (honestly, try DIY and crafts projects). By finding happiness in simple things, my Carbon footprint is already decreasing. I don't need to travel to be happy. I also don't need to buy stuff to be happy either. I typically find used electronics or leftover pieces of hardware to make some of my projects! The euphoric feeling of making something (no matter how crappy it turns out) is something that stays within me for quite some time, while my brothers momentary happiness of flying to mexico for a few days leaves him complaining a few days later about him being bored. You don't need much to be happy.I think you just need to find the things within you're self, even it causes you to be adventurous, to be happy in the long term. Most things that make people in the film--like being in a festival, hanging with friends, arts and crafts, or volunteering--are relatively simple things that require no excess. Maybe more people will opt out of the consumer life style if they discover that they don't really need to "buy" happiness, indirectly helping the climate crisis.

The film "Happy" reminds me of what I've seen though my travels to various parts of the world in the past few years; while I'm currently in the midst of my (unhappy) pursuit of graduation, I constantly think of ways to draw strength and optimism from single bits of happiness in life. When I traveled, I was less interested in taking photos at the famous landmarks, and instead paid more observation to people's lifestyles and what makes them truly enjoy life. These folks never shared the perceived model of success or so-called "happiness" that's defined in the UCSB circle, but they were able to appreciate the small, minimalist things within their reach; on the contrary, some of us always seem to chase after something they don't have, but "could for the better". In reality, this never-ending hunt for happiness is exactly the reason we are not able to live the present and find happiness neither from the past, or the future. We should never stress over things we don't need or cannot achieve within a short period of time, just because they appear "attractive" to materialistic minds.

<br><br>


Let that be a constant reminder for someone with a tumultuous past who's currently on the search for their next chapter of happiness...

I agree with everything you said, I lived in Dubai before I came to the US and they introduced something in the government, which at the time to be honest I found ridiculous: the department of happiness. It was a whole department in the government that was dedicated to ensuring that people are happy, living plentiful lives. And I feel like that is what the US needs, take a second to look away from materialism, from politics, from the ‘American Dream’ and just focus on what will truly make them happy.

As a second watch for me, this was a pleasant film as I have remembered it. Today, actually, a very popular Korean pop artist was to release her own song called Happy, being her birthday, yet her father passed away on this very day. I just happened to think of this as I write this response in thinking about the connection between her song, and this movie. This movie displays a life that many could be pursuing presently, in addition to things like community living. // One of the most important takeaways from the documentary for me was that 50% of your levels of happiness is genetically determined and 40% is from intentional activity. This means that a significant portion of my levels of happiness can be changed based on my own actions and choices. Therefore, I can definitely change the level of my happiness. The documentary touched on the idea that people that focus more on the intrinsic goals of personal growth, relationships, and the desire to help, over the extrinsic goals of money, image, and status, are happier. I have personally seen the effects of changing one’s goals. I definitely feel happier focusing on helping others compared to when I am worried about my image, status, and material things. I have also recently really shifted my perspective on my life and decided to try to be more positive and I have definitely seen a significant change in my level of happiness. Therefore, I agree that it is very possible to change and choose to be happier through taking different actions. I was also not very surprised to learn that once basic needs are met, an increase in wealth does not mean an increase in the level of happiness. This is because oftentimes people that focus on wealth tend to fall into the concept of the hedonic treadmill where one is never satisfied with what they have. This constant pursuit for more wealth and more material goods is stressful and never ending.

The film and Ken bring up an interesting thing to think about: the happiness that we get from what we do and the consequences behind them. Learning that while we are being happy, the world is suffering because of this. An impending question is: Is our happiness take priority over the very condition of the earth. When learning that the top 5 happiest countries emit about half of our emissions is absolutely insane which goes to show that us as a country may be excessively emissions. Many of these countries at the top for happiness tend to be countries that live in colder climates than us and yet they use far less energy than us. The fact that they range from using ½ to ¼ of our energy while their country demands more is something that we need to think about. We are using so much more energy than them and we are not as happy. We learn that using all this excess isn’t making us happy. We also learn money isn’t directly related to our happiness. It was very interesting to learn that the average person in Sweden only works 30 hours/week while average americans work around 42 hours a week and that they are paid around the same amount of money. The amount of benefits that Sweden offers compared to those of Americans is very different, but we learn that Sweden emits around ¼ of our emissions. This just goes to show that reducing our carbon emissions doesn’t mean that we are going to live much more difficult lives that will drastically change the way that we live our life, but instead we can be happier due to the fact that we are changing and we are doing things that will benefit the world in the future. When I take a look at the other countries around the world that have higher happiness levels than us, I’m not jealous but I have a feeling that we can do that too and that if we can change, we can be happier.

I really like the concept of life being like a "loan from God"  that we should pay back with interest. The two main feelings I associate with happiness are gratitude for the life that I have and pride in the way that I choose to live it. I have worked a lot of jobs including being a busboy, a waiter, and a tutor. While I made significantly more money working in restaurants than I did as a tutor, I found myself much happier helping students learn than I did waiting tables and making tips. The satisfaction that comes from helping another person is impossible to match with a new t-shirt or video game.

A portion of the films we have watched, including "Happy", continuously prove that nowhere in the recipe for happiness does it call for the destruction of the natural world or immense amounts of money and belongings. The ingredients for happiness are more intrinsic: self motivation, community/family support, doing good for others, etc..  Although there exists all of this scientific research about the true nature of happiness, people today (specifically in the U.S.) are as unhappy as ever because of their unwavering focus on the extrinsic things in life (money, clothes, status, etc.). This motivation to accumulate more wealth and more things not only takes a toll on the emotional and physical wellbeing of human beings, it takes an enormous toll on the environment as well. 
<br><br>
Although the film "Happy" is not an environmental one per say, it does shed light upon the rampant consumerism currently taking hold of people worldwide, which in turn causes devastation to the natural world. Many talk about happiness and monetary wealth correlating with one another, but this film shows that even those with little money and a "less desirable" quality of life can be the most rich with happiness. Everyone in the film who said they were truly living a happy life were not millionaires or people living in huge houses, they simply had people surrounding them who loved them and a motivation that kept them just busy enough. On the other hand, those who were depicted in "better" living situations or with higher paying jobs never had a smile on their face, and in Japan were even known to literally work themselves to death (Karoshi). There is no positive correlation between happiness and wealth, but it has become increasingly obvious that the ever growing consumerist lifestyle has a negative relationship with the world and the people living on it.

After watching Happy, I was shocked at seeing the comparison of how people talked about their happiness in the United States versus places outside of the US. It was shocking to me seeing people who lived in such poverty to feel genuinely happy and how people in the US who have the dream job, loads of money, and so many things that are just miserably unhappy. It helped put a lot in perspective for me regarding life in general and life in an environmentalist standpoint. It showed me that money doesn't buy happiness. There are so many things in life that I should be devoting my day to day life to that actually will make me happy. These things don't include tangible things. I have been trying to get better on a day to day life to soak up nature and my relationships with people to be happy rather than taking my extra time to surf the web for more clothes. That's where the environmental point comes into play. If everyone in the US were to have this understanding that the things that we buy don't equal happiness, but the things we do and the relationships that we have do, we would be better off mentally and environmentally.  We all need to take time to reflect on what makes us happy. Obviously there will be bumps in the road and things that stress us out, but a general idea of what makes us happy. For me, hanging out with my friends, cooking, and going on runs makes me happy. None of these require me to buy into the clothing industry, where a lot of people find their happiness. I hope that one day we are able to realize that things don't make us happy, but actions and relationships do.

I found the film “Happy” very informative. One thing that interested me the most about it is how they said money is not a key source of happiness (assuming you already have enough money for necessities). As someone who always wants more money so I can do things I cannot do at the moment (travel more, got to festivals etc) I find it hard to believe. I know people who are very rich can still have mental health issues and not be happy for a plethora of different reasons, but I feel like on average, a rich person will have less stress than a working class person (making ends meet, paying bills, providing for family etc) and will be able to freely do things that make them happy. That is something that a working class person can only do a little of in comparison. That being said, the film mentioned something called a hedonic adaptation that made sense to me. As you grow wealthier you adapt to your circumstances and that will always leave you wanting more. A never ending cycle of not being satisfied.

I too agree that being wealthy makes you happier. However,  I think this depends on how you are raised. For a lot of us we were raised in a society that supports consumerism and excess consumption. It is all we know. In this case I think money definitely makes you happier. If you have more money you can simply do more. In addition if you have more money you can spend less time working eventually and more time consuming. However we get stuck on the hedonistic treadmill as mentioned in this film and nothing is ever enough. Furthermore, this lifestyle is just horrible for the environment and those that don't get to live like this, aka the poor, pay for most of the consequences. On the other hand, if you grow up in a culture that values connectivity and the simple things in life more than consumption you can be very happy with a little bit of money.

My favorite part of this film was when it went into the segment about Melissa Moody. This was also the saddest part of the film but for me it had the biggest take away. Melisa lost so much from just a freak accident and at points considered killing herself because she thought shed never enjoy life again. But what she eventually realized was that she didn't understand happiness in the first place. Her happiness before came From trivial things in life like beauty which she had to learn to overcome when she lost her looks and her previous life. I just thought this section was very relevant because I think a lot of people put way to much emphasis on things that shouldn't matter so much in life. But hey that just how our culture raised us.

I really love this movie, in a way watching "Happy" makes me happy. I think that I have always been told to strive to attain a good life through a good career that would get you good money so that I could have a nice big house and whatever else I might like. Especially coming from a town that is small, in a less-desirable environment, and economically depressed. I couldn't blame my parents for telling me that I had to do good in school so that I could "get out" of that town– they love me and want me to do well, they didn't want me to have to go through things that they did. Even still, I never found myself wanting that fancy kind of lifestyle. Of course I knew that I never wanted to struggle, but I found I was the most happy when surrounded by family and friends, no matter the location, no matter the status, I have never cared about having those material things. I even liked being from my hometown, I liked the desert, I liked the fact that my dad worked on the railroad and that my mom was a waitress, I liked living in my grandparents house. 
<br><br>
This film brought all of this to the surface. I think that life could be so much nicer if the market was more heavily regulated and if people weren't so obsessed with material things. I think that we get fooled into believing that the best things in life can be bought or enhanced by having nice things. In reality, or my version of reality, past a certain level of human necessity, the best things in life remain the same, no matter the stuff you own.

As Ken just said in this video, and you mentioned, we as Americans always want more. Houses, cars, food, you name it. When he was listing these items and as I watched “Happy,” a “motivational” quote my dad and I have said for years now popped into my head. We started saying it whenever school got tough or I felt discouraged, or I really just lacked motivation. It goes, “work hard, big house, big cars.” And for a really long while this actually motivated me to throw my head down and keep grinding for a successful future. 
<br><br>

I think both of our parents want the same thing for us. They want to see their children live a more successful life (success equaling more stuff, since we live in America) and do what they couldn’t do themselves. I feel like now I can’t have the same approach to what my dad and I would say to each other though. This film (and class in general) really makes me re-evaluate why all the goals I’ve set for myself are the way they are, and what really drives them. As you mentioned, a materialist-driven market has a huge effect. I think now approaching my future, I want to live it small. Bigger does NOT equal better, and at the end of the day if I am happy living my life, who cares how much stuff is in it or how much space I own!

I've always lived in fairly-well off cities in heavily populated areas, which is different from you. Yet, I've spent most of my life regretting and wondering what it would be like to live in a different place. Maybe it's the emotional music I'm listening to right now, but it came to my mind that I've always been a bit envious of other people's lives, even if they're not living the American dream lifestyle or living in Sweden. I don't want to travel, but I want to have what they have: the type of happiness that Happy shows and values. I really like reading, and I can literally scream because of the best part of a book, but I still don't know which is more fun and meaningful: reading an epically awesome book (or thousands) or having a best friend. Based off of Happy, I bet that having emotional connections and helping others would be more fulfilling. It's a bit disappointing for me, since reading an interesting book is way easier than trying to connect with people. The way our society is set up also makes it hard, since it's easier to look at your phone during an elevator ride than try to converse with the stranger, but potential friend, next to you. If I sat next to someone in a place with lots of space, not that I'd want to, I'd be eyed weirdly. If I talked to a stranger out of nowhere, I might be thought of as weird or creepy. In other cultures, it's different. I remember hearing stories about how people could just walk in and share a meal casually.  
<br><br>

Honestly, I wasn't really happy when watching Happy. It was a bit annoying to watch, and I often doubted whether the more impoverished areas were truly all that happy, but, in the end, I have fond memories of Happy. Although I was still a bit doubtful, and I still am because it's so difficult to change a belief that you've grown up with, I felt a bit reassured that happiness that doesn't depend on money exists and is possible. No matter how much I try, some part of me still feels that just a little bit more money, enough to buy something nice or have the best doctor or health insurance possible for my parents, would make my life a lot smoother and happier. In the end, the U.S. dictates that even if I don't want material happiness, I still have to pursue wealth for happiness to happen in relationships. If I don't have enough money to help myself, how can I help my friends and family? Not to mention that our current society builds relationships through spending money, as seen from how dating costs money. Also, would I be happy if I didn't have enough money to pay medical bills for my loved ones? It's a bit early to worry, but I'm already a bit anxious. I want the type of happiness that Happy and other films in the class show, but I'm wondering if it's possible if our society doesn't change. I've always been disappointed by the world, but I'm hoping that change will happen.
<br><br>

Anyways, great comment, and I'm glad that you know what you want. Your comment was the first one that resonated with the emotional music I'm listening, late hour, and what I wanted to say.

The film "Happy" basically helps me to redefine what is happiness. I feel happy can let me do better in daily life, behave more confidently in relationships. Happy is an emotion which is very important to human beings, but still a lot of get depression and other psychological disorders. As the level of happiness is mostly based on genetic factors, we still can participate in activities or exercises to get happiness. However, money does not bring happiness. 
<br><br>
The film transports information by showing the audience groups of people who present either happy or unhappy in different situations. It compares these people at two opposite sides, telling the audience that how happy we are is not based on the amount of money we have; in fact, we need to find the nature of happiness. The film talks a lot about the people living in poor and far areas who are happy and satisfied about their life. It makes people think what we can change in our life to make ourselves happier. 
<br><br>
I learned that happy is an emotion which is very important to human beings, but now there are a lot of people getting depression and other psychological illnesses. These illnesses mostly attribute to stress. For example, people who live in Japan are living in a high-pressure environment. They need to bear the pressure from work, family, and relationships. These stressful factors make them unhappy and exhausted, so they have a higher risk to get depression. I believe some of people have already concerned about this issue, but it is hard to make a change in a short time in one specific region. The film basically helps me to redefine what is happiness. Happiness lets me do better in studying and behave more confidently in social life. It makes me to maintain a good mood, which I can do everything very actively. The film is thoughtful, it causes me to think about how I can always maintain a positive emotion. Money does not bring happiness. Based on statistics, the level of happiness a person have is almost the same at different amount of income. Instead, the level of happiness mostly depends on genetic factors. Except for genetic genes, people can participate in activities or exercises to increase happiness. The film changes my attitude that every person may shows happy in various of ways, but it is important to stay happy.

This weeks film was very enjoyable.  I really loved the message that was being sent throughout the entire film.  What I took out of it was you do not need multiple different items to make you happy.  Such as, you do not need a lot of clothes to make you happy.  You do not need materialistic things to bring you happiness.  In the film, there were many cases where people did not have much, did not have a lot of money to buy multiple things.  For example, the people that lived out in the wilderness.  They survived such as the natives would, they would hunt and gather different items to eat.  They had little to no clothes, they camped out, and they were always together.  Most importantly they were happy.  Although they did not have nice things, or in today's society "nice things" and a "normal life" they had each other.  Just being together, doing things together made them happy.  In the film it was mentioned that nothing made them happier than simply being together and doing everything together.  They really lived by the motto of, "no man left behind." 

<br><br>

When I finished watching the film, I began to reflect on my own life and what really made me happy.  What brought  me real happiness.  And I realized that it was not the materialistic things such as clothes, shoes, technology, money.  But what really makes me happy is the people around me the people I care about.  Happiness does not come from materialistic things but from things you truly care about, things you really can not be without.  I think everyone should think and reflect on what happiness truly is, and what actually brings you happiness.  Because there many people who truly believe buying multiple items will bring them happiness.  But is it true happiness, or just satisfaction?  Everybody should really reflect on that statement because it is very important.

As the film explores the feeling of happiness, and its linkage to dopamine, it began to confirm what I had known was true.  Money doesn’t buy happiness.  Money buys experiences.  Experiences can lead to happiness.  Generally speaking, I have been living in this effect for a few years.  I tend to justify spending larger amounts of money on experiential things rather than material things.  I think that we need to keep things like this in mind because I know for many people it’s easy to deny this as true and just keep buying things in order to fill the “void.”  However, this feeds our society right into capitalism, and continues the fast fashion and other industries which are detrimental to our climate.  

<br><br>

This movie brought back up the idea we continuously return to throughout the quarter, of the American Dream, and the societal assumptions put into place that material wealth determines your value as a person.  We need to break down this stereotype, this assumed value that we place on materiality and wealth in general, because in reality you aren’t happier just because you own more things.  We can see this throughout the film, we watch as this driver in India, he doesn’t have much going for him material-wise, but he has so much joy in his life.  How do we break down these stereotypical societal assumptions?  I don’t know at this point how to make a big change, but we can start with ourselves.  Don’t concern yourself with your material wealth.  Concern yourself with your wealth in mind and spirit.  And don’t inflict these societal norms upon others.  Keep and open mind, in fact, how about we just try not to judge other people’s lives??

The film Happy was a very thought-provoking story about finding the meaning of happiness. In one section of the film, the writers explored the chemical side of happiness by detailing the effect dopamine has on us. It was interesting to learn its effects, but more importantly, it made me think about what we must do in order to release dopamine into our system. I think that in today’s society, many people attempt to provoke their dopamine by buying bigger and better things, thinking that this will be the key solution to their happiness. I actually believe the opposite is occurring with these actions. 
<br><br>


When looking at some of the happiest times in my life, I can clearly remember being surrounded by friends, family, and a fun atmosphere. However, I do not recall any situations where I was genuinely filled with joy from a purchase I had made. This point was similarly made in the movie, claiming that any materialistic achievements or purchases were fleeting happiness at most. This is a very interesting concept to approach from a film perspective, but I found it to be incredibly insightful, and it really made me rethink some of the ways I “achieve happiness” in my day to day life. I hope others can take away that key message the same as I did and will be able to work towards creating a better, more fulfilling life for themselves.

The film “Happy” was very enlightening. I had no clue that we are born with genes that determine a range of our happiness. In addition, we can do physical activities to increase our dopamine-release such as running, swimming, and dancing. I always feel good after swimming! It’s all connected! Happiness is very important and plays a role in all aspects of our lives. It’s important to remember that success and happiness does not necessarily mean more money. We need to stop monetizing happiness. I’ve found that those who live simpler lives tend to be more happy. It’s the little things that matter the most. One can also find happiness in nature. I personally love going to the beach and paddling in the water; it always makes me feel better. I appreciated the uplifting tone of this documentary. Healthiness and happiness go hand-in-hand. For example, eating healthy foods like fruits and vegetables significantly contribute to happiness. It feels good to eat good. I was shocked to learn that over 40% of our happiness comes from our own personal actions. It’s reassuring to know that I have that type of control.

After watching this film, it really revitalized the way I felt about my purpose in life. In this country, we are always thrust into believing that money is the key to success and happiness. However, now all I want to do is find happiness among the ones I love and hold closest too. Its crazy to see how some people who Americans would consider 'broke' and 'hopeless' to be filled with joy in their lives. I feel like I have gained some insight on how to rethink how I come about on making my life better through relationships, and not to fill it with material items that will eventually become worthless.

The film "happy" said something that immediately caught my attention upon watching the film. One of the scientists says that about 50% of our happiness is predetermined by our genes, and that we all have a set level of happiness that we return to when we experience joy. At first I found this unbelievable. I mean how can something like joy be predetermined? But then it hit me: I respond to happiness in almost the exact same way that my mom does, and similar to that of my maternal grandfather. Another statement that caught my attention, that being that roughly 40% of our happiness is related to what we do to create happiness. This is something that I have observed over my lifetime. People who workout and have leisure time to allocate towards things they are passionate about seem to be the most happy and fulfilled. Growing up, my Dad worked two or three jobs simultaneously and never had time to relax. It was always wake up, eat, work, eat, and then sleep over and over again. It was at this point that he was at his unhappiest, even though he was able to provide a good life for himself. Recently, his business partner sold their business and left my dad without a cut or a job.  Oddly enough, I've never seen him happier. He gets to spend all of the time he never could with me with my baby sister, he and his wife seem to be happier, and he has more time to workout and do things he couldn't before. I actually get phone calls from him because he wants to hang out. I think "Happy" really opened my eyes to what I find really important, not just because of the touching anecdotes, but how I can relate its message to my personal life.

This was my favorite viewing so far. Everything about how it was shot, incorporating such a diversity of opinions, was so essential to get the full picture. The documentary lent a global feel to a very personal concept. I loved the look at communal living in the Northern countries, I absolutely never even considered it before, but now thinking on how amazing it would be to raise my future children with like-minded parents who can split the duties of the household sounds really appealing. 
<br><br>
Something that stunned me was that circumstances and upbringing only account for 10% of a person's happiness, while genetics account for 50%, and things we can actually do account for 40%. I honestly thought about 90% of our happiness came from genetics, but reconsidering that has opened my eyes to something that I think I knew all along which is this: small changes in my lifestyle that keep me on my toes are the things that keep me happy. Within the last 2 weeks, I've switched majors, gone vegetarian (to a large extent), and started working out everyday. I find I'm more fulfilled in my relationships, I sleep better, and I feel and look better. It's cool to think of happiness as a science because it's so easy for me to get in my own head and blame myself when I feel bad, when in reality a series of hormones and chemical interactions are the culprits. Once I figure out the science behind happiness, I know it's just the scientific method to see what things make me happy.

I was also shocked to learn that genetic plays such a determining role in a person's happiness level as I've always thought the surrounding environment and experiences influence happiness the most. Nevertheless, I was surprised again later to find out that our dopamine level decays over time; this sort of made me to reflect on the fact that maybe I should start taking care of my mental wellbeing by engaging in more activities. The other thing that had my attention was the cultural contrast between the majority of Japan and the islands of Okinawa. People live distinctively different lives and it really showed us that the shortcuts to happiness claimed by the neuroscientists are convincing after all. Anyways, this video made me reflect on how I could be a happier person and the ways in which I could achieve my goals.

The documentary Happy, is one of my favorite documentaries we have watched during this course. There is something in this film that everyone can take away, as it applies differently to each person. The happiness class at Harvard would totally be a class that I would take. I feel like it would be a class that would stick with you even after school. I probably would not, however, do the Gorilla Run in San Francisco. I already get a good amount of exercise, and I don’t need to wear a costume to run. Although, the people that are doing it do seem like they are having fun. I understand the closeness of the Blanchard family because I have a very large and tightly knit family myself. I have always found that I am happiest when surrounded by my family. We make each other happier, and there is a feeling when we are all with each other that can’t quite be put into words. I loved the speech that the comedian/educator gave. He taught a message that so many kids that age need to hear, as it is a time when so many kids are learning about the world and the people around them. It is something I wish was presented at my middle school.

I have the same feeling as you do after watching this film. Up to now, this is the only documentary that creates a delightful atmosphere. I love the way that people living together with not so much material consumption and when people seeks small happiness from small things in their lives such as coming home after a whole day’s work seeing his child waiting for him at the door and calling out “baba”. It’s so sweet and comforting to see this from a society that most people are looking for material satisfaction from consuming, isn’t it? I’m very glad that I can relate to your happiness from living with a large family. I also live in a family of many members and I understand the feeling that “can’t be put into words”. I always feel safe and happy with my family. I believe that a person’s value is largely determined by the education of one’s family. My family has always encouraged me to consume less and not to seek satisfaction through buying stuff, and I hope I can pass this value on to the next generation.

From Ashes to Ashes, and Dust to Dust. A few weeks ago I went to church and heard a full sermon on that, as it was Ash Wednesday. The whole sermon can essentially be summed up in one phrase: "you were born of dust, and to dust you shall return". That phrase kind of hits home relative to the movie "Happy". I could work my whole life to buy a mazi, build a mansion, wear some Armani, remodel my kitchen, drop racks on rolls, but to what purpose? If I'll just be ashes again someday, what good will any of these things do me? While they might bring me temporal pleasure in the sense that they're fun things to have, I will gain nothing from them in the bigger picture. At the end of my life, when I prepare to reunite with my ash self, I hope that I'll have a life full of memories to cherish, not a room full of things to look at while I whither. 
<br><br>

What I'm trying to say is that all the material possession in the world won't matter once I make it to the end of my life, as I won't be able to carry them with me at death. No matter if you're religious or not, death is where we part ways with material. The only thing we can truly carry with us is the memories we made. This holds true throughout life as well, not even just in death. If you put me on a life raft in the middle of the ocean, my mazi won't do me any good, but my memories will. It is important to stress the less physical aspects of wealth, as these are the ones that you will always have with you, and be able to carry on with forever.

This was by far one of my favorite films that we have watched for this class over the entire quarter, as it deals with an idea of happiness that everybody spends their entire lives in search for. I found the film very compelling and inspiring, and it really moved me and pushed me to be more intentional in my life in my own search for happiness. I think the film does a very good job debunking this idea that money and material wealth correlates with happier lives, because it really doesn't. I remember when Demar Derozen, a NBA athlete, a couple years ago detailed in an interview his struggle with depression. Everyone was so shocked to see a star professional athlete, and a multimillionaire at that, struggling with finding happiness in his life; however, that is a harsh reality which a growing hyper-consumer culture in America fails to reveal. Obviously money is critical in supporting basic needs, but when you have enough money to provide yourself with basic needs such as food, water, shelter, healthcare, and education more money beyond that is not the answer to happiness. It is refreshing to see the families, like the ones in Louisiana, who might exist in an abundance of wealth but remain in a state of happiness by experiencing joy in natural wonders and by surrounding themselves with family.  Happiness isn't something that can be given to you by someone else, or a certain product. It is something that you have to find yourself, and it is something that changes from person to person. I think it is important for people to begin looking for happiness in that way rather than searching for it in a society that constantly tells you that material wealth is the solution when it really is not. For me, I find happiness in surrounding myself with people I love, friends and family, and by being outdoors and experiencing the wonders of nature.

your example of Demar Derozen was very fitting for this context. 
<br><br>


Western societies, such as the United States, have really transformed the definition of happiness. Happiness is seen as a result of money, fame, and material wealth as you mention. As a result, we as humans naturally think that having those 3 assets is a gateway to happiness. Thus, we spend our entire lives trying to achieve it in any way possible. I saw another comment here mention that the average workweek in the United States is 50hrs/week compared to Switzerland's 30 hrs/week - we spend our entire lives grinding to try achieve "material" success. In reality however, no amount of "material" success is ever enough - once you get a certain amount you will always want more and it is very to get stuck in a cycle that is working against your happiness. 
<br><br>


We, as society, need to realize that material success is not equivalent to happiness. As seen in the case of Demar Derozan, a multimillionaire professional athlete, material success is definitely not a prerequisite to happiness. Happiness can be found in the smaller things in life - spending time with family and friends, going outdoors, doing the things you love, etc. If happiness can be drawn from these small but important aspects of life, it will be much easier to be happy.

I think our generation, having so much pressure put on our social media, and creating a perfect image, seeking outer validation has skewed what we see as happiness, our true understanding of it. We are used to following the extrinsic guidelines, of status, wealth, and image, and become consumed in having the nicest clothes, the newest car, and biggest house, traveling the world in ways that are harming it, and being so invested in the response to our experience by others rather than the experience itself. I am often guilty of this, sometimes I can remember a snapchat photo of a place I went better than the place itself, I am excited to post the instagram photo of the experience rather than truly taking it in for myself. In this process I am losing touch with the moment, I am losing the chance for those dopamine connections to happen, because I am so wrapped up in the extrinsic validation of my experience. I am not present in those moments, and not truly happy because my mind is somewhere else. And at the end of the day the likes and comments on the post don't fulfill me either and I am left trapped in this cycle. 
<br><br>
This film was like a breathe of fresh air, I saw how the happiest people often have the least, and are more appreciate for the little they do have. They are not trying to prove anything to anyone, social media doesn't even exist in their worlds, and they are present, mindful, empathetic, and real. They have faced real hardship and still choose to seek out happiness through intrinsic sources, such as doing things they love and connecting to others. They are more family oriented, connected to nature, and show an immense gratitude for what they have. 
<br><br>
This movie touched me, reminded me that it is not all about "chasing the bag" but rather about being yourself, being happy, being present. I often struggle with the idea of getting educated to get a job that makes money vs one that makes me happy, this movie reminded me that self fulfillment over a full bank account is always worth it. Like was mentioned, as soon as you live at a certain standard or comfortable state, all the excessities really don't create that big of a difference in the long run. Not only that but personally it would hurt me to know my excessive purchases were hurting our beloved Mother Nature. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone, thank you for sharing this.

I like your idea about social media. It is true that greatly affect us. With social media, it bring us great convenience that people have a easier access  to other people's life. The action of showing off on the social media will affect people's vanity. People eventually get hooked in the social media and lost themselves in it. A lot of crime events such as thief or rub and related with social media, especially for young generations. When everyone is pursing their life in money, they change and reshape the American dream. It becomes a life with larger house, better cars and more expensive clothing. People get lost in these things. However, nobody ever ask the question that do we really need it? Do we really feel happier than our childhood, when we do not have any money and we are easy to feel satisfaction. Just like the data shown, once we exceed the limit of amount of money we need for a family, the higher the money you have do not means the happier life you have. Norway, Swiss and all other countries proved that. It is time for us to rethink and realize what is really important for us.
<br><hr>
This movie also touched me and made me rethink a lot of my priorities in life. Our society has us locked in constant competition so that we may gain capital, and that we can prove that we are "the best" at something. Yet I loved how the film explained that the people with the least and the people who have faced adversity are the happiest. 
<br><br>


It was incredibly interesting to see comparisons between different countries and their goals/values. Looking at the high stress rate in Japan versus how the government in Bhutan places happiness over economic growth was incredibly wholesome. I've never really considered that happiness and well-being are a responsibility for the government to take, but the more I think about it the more sense it makes. And although it would take major internal reforms, I think such a shift in values could happen in the United States. 

<br><br>

Watching this film could not have come at a better time for me. I am also guilty of publishing any glamorous experience I may encounter, or I tend to romanticize certain parts of my life because I am genuinely terrified for the future of our planet and for my own future. But watching "Happy" reminded me that not everything is a race or a competition, and I don't have to gain capital to be valid. This film let me know that saving ourselves can also save our planet.

<br><hr>
Exactly! I totally agree that people have the wrong idea of the "American Dream" I mean look at the chaos we are in right now. Almost every country gets paid sick leave accept America, they can go home to their friends and families and feel safe during this chaotic time. Meanwhile we don't have the funds for healthcare but we do for big corporations that are harming the environment? It is crazy to see how corrupt the system is when it all falls apart but at the same time it's beautiful to see how people find their true valuables amidst it. How they now aren't so focused on new clothes, or having the newest cars, but cherish what they do have, and take time to connect with the family and people they are with.

After watching the film “Happy,” I feel really thankful for everything I have in my life so far. An excellent, thought provoking movie that will grab attention and heart. This should be required viewing for everyone. It is interesting and rewarding that Hollywood would produce for us a documentary on Happiness but at the same time has been a large contributor to trying to make us believe, falsely, what makes us happy. There is a well done piece also about what doesn't make kid's happy. It seems a shame that the producers found it necessary to search around the world to find happiness.
<br><br>
Although the U.S. was one of the richest countries, it was nowhere near the happiest, and also according to a lot of researches, materially successful people in the U.S. were often less happy than their gardeners. In order to make this movie investigating what makes people happy, the director goes to Denmark, Namibia, Scotland, China, Kenya, Brazil, Japan, Bhutan and India and interviews a bunch of people and the result is quite an interesting movie on how things play out. I believe that if people begin to focus more on intrinsic goals rather that extrinsic, there is going to be a happier world. It's interesting to see the contrasts and it may well give some inspiration for our own lives.

I couldn't resonate more with your comment. "Happy" was probably one of my favorite films that weve watched in this class so far. It was so interesting to hear that the climate crisis actually has a drastic affect on our happiness. I definitely agree with your statement about how Hollywood has almost created a "dream world" that encourages people to try to live lives they almost cannot achieve. I believe that it pushes social roles to a whole new level. For example, when watching a movie about a cool, masculine, and handsome guy who is always happy, it makes viewers believe that the only way to be happy is to follow this role. 
<br><br>
It was so interesting to see in the movie about the differences between our lifestyle and the lifestyles of other countries. While we are always so constantly craving the best new materialistic objects that we think will make us happy, people with less CO2 pollution are creating happiness so many healthier ways. The one aspect of this movie that i truly enjoyed was how it showed how people find love and happiness through family and friends. There were so many great examples of people feeling like they were so thankful and so blessed to have the least amount of material things, and having their families made them feel like they "had it all".

One thing the film, and Ken’s introduction of it, made me think hard about was the role of government in facilitating an environment where its citizens can be happy. While Ken talks a lot about the Nordic countries in his video, the place that the movie focuses on that I found super interesting was Bhutan. I wondered how this small developing nation in southern Asia could be such a happy place while also struggling to grow into the modern world. After hearing more on it, I was impressed by Bhutan’s government and their decision to prioritize gross national happiness over gross national product (GDP). I was amazed by the decision of a developing country to emphasize this in a time when development is key to catalyzing economic growth, especially within that region of the world, and I commend their decision. It is a balance between growing and remaining happy, because if you grow too fast or too suddenly you can begin losing a sense of identity and culture that makes you who you are. I think the idea that as humans we have to be searching for something more than GDP or development is crucial in taking these steps as a nation towards gross national happiness. With that said, however, I did some more digging and I found out that the population of Bhutan is only slightly above 800,000 people. In America, I think our population is much too big and diverse to really implement these key ideas to the same extent Bhutan has on a federal level. However, I think that local government is the first key place we should begin prioritizing, or at least finding a balance between development and happiness, because American communities deserve that.

This is one of my favorite films among the ones we’ve watched for class because while this film is still talking about environmental impact, one of its central themes is about how to be happy. Through the film, the filmmakers try to express the fact that material items are not what makes people happy. There are a number of ways that we can achieve happiness, having a sense of community and meditation are one of the many methods that were covered in the film. However, society tells us, wrongly, that material items determine our status and happiness. Ads portray happy people with products, conveying society’s belief of the importance of material items. Happy places emphasis on what really matters, what really makes us happy, the people around you and finding a sense of self. Take for example the man who died of overwork in Japan in the film. In his pursuit for the material items for not only him, but his family, he ended up not spending as much time with them. Not only that, but he then passed away from overwork, and his young daughter will never be able to spend time with him ever again. I feel as if this example really puts things into perspective. It goes to show how our time in the world is really limited, and we should be choosing carefully how to spend it. Instead of focusing on the pursuit of wealth and material items, we should be choosing to spend more of it on the people that we care about, and of course, ourselves. 
 <br><br>
In the video, Ken mentions how the USA is ranked as number nineteenth on happiest countries despite being the biggest contributor to carbon emissions. Countries such as Sweden, Finland, and Costa Rica have a much lower carbon footprint, and yet, despite that, they are ranked higher than the US. This goes to show that putting more carbon into the atmosphere through rampant consumerism and wastefulness does not make us any happier. This fact kind of astounds me, because while I believe that material items are definitely not what makes us happy, it is interesting to see that there is very literal evidence of this fact. We should all be more aware of this phenomenon so that we are more careful about where we spend our time and money creating a more environmentally green society as well as a happier one.

I totally agree with your comment. Similar to you, I thought it was interesting how Ken showed us factual evidence that material goods don’t make us happy. We emit ¼ of all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, yet we are 19th on the list of happiest countries. Hearing that the top 5 happiest countries emit much less than us was shocking. While I have always been told that material goods don’t make us happy, I was blown away how much of a disconnect there is. I think it is really interesting that reducing our carbon footprint won’t just make us happier, but it will help the planet too! While I don’t believe in all of the policies of Democratic Socialism, I think we should take notes on the top 5 happiest countries. They are clearly helping their citizens, while still having a low carbon footprint. 
 <br><br>
If America continues on our path of putting work before happiness, we will end up like Japan. We need to recognize our detrimental behavior and change our culture. By taking days off, spending time to do hobbies we enjoy, and meditating, we can each implement this in our everyday lives. It is crucial for us to realize that we can still be happy (in fact, happier), if we reduce our CO2 footprint!

 I totally agree with your perspective that the material items are not what makes people happy, and as well, I am totally into this film. Rather than talking about environmental issues or how to address today’s global warming problem, the film “Happy” focus on components that constitute one’s happiness for their entire life, which is a hot topic in contemporary society in that with the rise of living standard, increasing number of people shift their focus to the  happiness index. To be surprise, the material items only occupy 10% of the entire happiness components. Like you said, our society tells us the only way to be happy is to make enough money and then to fulfill the consumption list. Most of us identify fulfilling material items as the fundamental components to be happiness. I did not realize the limit of the idea until I watched the film “Minimalism”, which enables me to realize one’s desire is endless. You could not always fulfill the thing you want. It is true that when we gain something that we desperately want, we definitely will feel happy; however, these happiness will not last too long. Once the novelty ware off, the happiness will disappear as well. In addition, material items even add unhappiness towards us. The more we want, the more we will spend. Once one could not afford the check, he may well be unhappy and consider himself usefulness. 


 <br><br>

Back to the other two components of happiness: genetic accounts for 50% and the intentional activity accounts for 40%, which means most of your happiness depends on yourself rather than things you want. Let’s try to imagine these two scenarios and make a choose: spending one day with your parents or buying something you long for. Unhesitatingly, I will choose the first one in that my parents are always too busy to accompany me. If I could use those material things in exchange for their accompany, why would I hesitate? Thus, it is easy to see that everyone has different attitudes towards happiness. It is better for to pursue his own happiness instead of jumping into the material items bandwagon and simply follow others.
<br><hr>


I agree, I think this film brings up a very unique aspect to this class. I thought it was very interesting and even refreshing to see this video with such a nice focus, rather than our usual films that usually end up leaving me feeling quite helpless or sad. I think that there are definitely things that can be learned from films like this one, however I feel like not everything in this film can necessarily be applied to all people. For instance, I believe that money definitely plays a role in a person's happiness, because with more money comes more opportunities and more possibilities, however I feel like this film tries to romanticize the idea that money has absolutely nothing to do with happiness.

Before I address the film itself, I feel like I have to address Ken’s lecture for the film and that the average swede for example is both significantly happier than the average american, and also produces a shockingly ¼ the carbon footprint of the average american not factoring in the huge climate difference between our countries. I think this is an important thing to point out that higher carbon footprints do definitely not lead to higher happiness levels as corporations and the government want us to believe, but instead may actually be an inverse relationship, as if your carbon footprint is high you are less likely to be happy. I think that the figure for Americans got getting any happier after earning more than 75k a year is because at that point money for the your essential life needs no longer becomes an issue, and instead any more money than that gets funneled into worthless junk and social status. (I assume) that why people of the nordic countries are able to be so happy is they don’t have to worry about what will happen to them if they can’t cover the expenses of our very “free market” system because their government looks out for them (which is why swedes are so happy with paying such a large portion of their income for taxes in contrast to us americans).
 <br><br>

I had seen the film Happy before, but I had completely forgotten all of it, so I again was surprised that 50% of our happiness was based on our genetics, but even more so that a whole 40% is based off of the novel activities/experiences we have that give us dopamine release. I feel like it is extremely important then to point out that our happiness is based on the “spice of life” and how meaningless everything we are told about happiness really is. Also, I thought it was really important how they pointed out that you can’t really be happy if you are lonely, and instead because humans are social creatures you need to make sure that you put in time to maintain those close relationships.

I very much enjoyed watching the documentary "Happy" and seeing real-life examples of people that found true happiness. The two stories that stuck out to me the most was the woman who was hit by a truck and had to have over 30 surgeries to reconstruct her facial structure and the story of the woman in Denmark I believe who moved into a housing complex with several other families. Both were amazing examples of people who went through a really hard time, temporarily lost hope, and found their way back by finding happiness in new things. I also found it really inspiring that most happy people have very strong bonds with their family and friends. This truly shows that our environment and the people around us have such a big part in defining our happiness and helping us live a fulfilled life. The clips shown in the movie of African tribes playing games and dancing together made me feel really sentimental. I think it's such a shame that Africa is always thought of as having so much poverty and misery and is always portrayed as needing help from us "developed" countries. In reality, we could use some of those African cultures as inspirations to improve our own. There are a lot of African tribes and societies that are perfectly content with the life they are living. I really wish our society would start to cherish the important things in life and stop trying to focus all of our attention on money and profit.
 <br><br>
I definitely understand why Ken wanted us to watch this documentary this week. Even though it doesn't directly address climate change or environmental action, it definitely ties in with the issues we discussed in this class. One of the reasons why our carbon footprint is so big and why we emit so many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is because our society and economy are driven by money and materialism. If we could collectively change our values and stop trying to find happiness in wealth and status, maybe we would be able to reduce our carbon footprint the way Scandinavian countries have.

I think, “Happy,” really touches on the core of the issue of the climate crisis in the United States. It is no secret that people often search for happiness in the wrong places―these ‘wrong places’ being money, clothes, cars, appearances, etc. It’s also no secret that these views are quite strong in the United States. We live in a time and place that glamorizes living a luxurious and wealthy lifestyle with nice cars, frequent travel, and an expensive wardrobe. Because of this glorification, many people see this kind of lifestyle as their ultimate end goal in life. “Happy” does a successful job in explaining that living such a lifestyle has little to do with how happy we end up. I found it interesting, but not surprising that some of the happiest people are living in third world countries and in impoverished conditions. These people are not consumed by materialism and most likely live each day to the best that they can without constant longing for a bigger and better life. 
 <br><br>


I think this film should make us take a step back and think about where we are searching for happiness and if these are the places we should be looking. This film not only shows us anecdotal evidence, but scientific evidence. We are more likely to be happy through practicing compassion and finding the right places to put our time, effort, and value in. Our struggle to understand this comes with our struggles to understand ourselves. And as we struggle, our false ideas and perceptions of what will make us happy are fueling so many of our unsustainable practices and hence the degradation of our environment. 
 <br><br>
Searching for happiness in the wrong places is doing more than just holding us back from being happy, it is slowly killing our planet.

The film "Happy" was a film that really focused on the fact that happiness can't be bought. I thought it was really interesting to see the way the film was going to do this despite the fact people experience burden and distress due to being low-income, poor, etc. What I mean by that is that peoples financial situation really impacts their lives, so I wanted to see the way in which the film was going to address this. Like Ken said, "it is difficult to be happy if you are very poor". Overall, I'd say that the film was really interesting to watch and see the different stories of people they interviewed. I think my favorite thing about the film was the many different people they interviewed from all over the world. It was really impactful to be able to hear their stories. The opening scene where the man explains that despite his situation in working in taking people places in rickshaws and putting up with people who are rude to him he is grateful. He really focused on talking about how much he loves his kids and his family which I thought was really admirable.

I think this film was very interesting and eye opening. I have realized that I need to be doing more for myself that makes me truly happy. The statistic presented in the beginning of the film that stated where our happiness derives from was particularly interesting to me. I think this comment was particularly optimistic because it states that a little under half our happiness is controlled by our intentional behavior. When you think about it, that is a very big percentage, and therefore we have a lot of control over our own happiness. Another aspect of this film that particularly caught my attention was the segment regarding resilience. I think that many of us believe that truly happy people have not had to face hardships but that is not the case at all. The movie stated that the happiest people have actually had to go through more than you think, but the way they bounce back and grow from it leads to their happiness. I think this concept is very applicable to our daily lives. If we think of situations as a chance to learn and grow rather than be put down, we will be able to recover from the hardship much faster and be happier overall. I think this is something I am going to try to implement into my life whenever possible. Having an optimistic outlook on life will definitely make life more enjoyable overall. I think this was a very good film to watch with the climate crisis in mind because it reiterates the idea that psyciall stuff does not make us happier. The enormous amount of things we buy as an attempt to fill the voids in our lives are just simply creating more waste and increasing our climate emissions. If we were to follow some of the advice presented in this movie instead of feeling the need to buy a 5 bedroom house and 3 cars, we would ultimately be happier and decrease emissions.

The film "Happy" was really interesting because happiness is something that I have always seen as relative. This film just opens up the perspective on what can make a person happy. Happiness is something that differs from person to person knowing that people who live a very different lifestyle and life in general can and are probably more happy than Americans which is really eye-opening. I used to think that money can buy happiness to a certain extent. This just goes to show that money does not really buy you complete happiness after really having the basics. The American consumerist culture is all about having the next and new thing and after buying it people want the next new thing. Having this lifestyle will just make you buy things in order to be "happy" It is very crazy seeing that people can have a lot less and be extremely happy about what they have. From what it looks like people happiness should not rely on how many things that they have. I think that the American view on what makes people happy needs to change and not be looked like that. Instead of connecting happiness to being materialistic the consumerist culture would have to change. Being truly happy would be having things that would really treasure and spending time with family and friends. Spending time doing what you like and making that time as rewarding as it could be. The whole part about flow and how everyone's flow is very different from each other. Doing what you really like exercising even working in some cases. People have to truly see if they buy a new materialistic item that would make them any happy in the long run.

This week's film was very interesting to watch and was different from the ones we are usually assigned to view. 
 <br><br>

What I most enjoyed about the film was the Danish co-housing communities. This again helps tie into the concept of minimalism in that if you live in a smaller space it would encourage you to have fewer things. Occupying a smaller space helps limit the amount of energy used and is beneficial for our environment. Here in the US, I don’t typically see co-housing communities but thought it was such an interesting and great way to live. The families that occupied the space seemed to love it and it shows that you don’t need a lot of things in order to be happy. They are able to enjoy life with the presence and help of each other. 
 <br><br>

Another thing I found interesting was when scientist discovered the genetic set point which is, 50% of our fluctuations in happiness levels is due to genes. It also surprised me to see that work, money, and things such as health only make up 10%. I expected this number to be way higher considering work and money are usually what people seem to be more involved in and stress about.
 <br><br>

I also liked when the film brought up a point about those who practice meditation on kindness and compassion. I found it interesting that those who meditate improve their happiness levels more than those who are taking antidepressants. So many people practice meditation and are able to activate brain areas essential for their well-being. Although I have not personally tried meditation, this has inspired me to try one day and see if it is something I can get into.

I really enjoyed watching this film. It was truly interesting to learn that 50% of the potential happiness we can feel is determined by our genetics, 10% by our job, social status, and health, and 40% by our intentions and actions. People tend to think that so much of happiness depends on how much you make, how much you can buy, and that is how they set up their lives- by the job that can make them the most money. But that only constitutes 10% of one's happiness. While 50% of our happiness is controlled by genetics, it is nice to know that we can be responsible for 40% of our happiness. Just by being active, one can release dopamine and improve one’s mood. Not only that, but being physically active can improve your health (part of the 10%) which will further your overall happiness. I really loved the quote “try to work so you can live your life in tranquility”, you don’t need to amass an enormous amount of wealth to be happy (as we have already seen through minimalism, wealth and stuff does not ensure happiness), you need to focus on your actions- what makes you happy. Though at times it may be difficult, it is nice to know that we can (to a certain extent) choose to become happier by doing things we love, by not sitting stagnant. And, in focusing more on true physical happiness, and not the “happiness” brought by stuff, we can also help the planet. Happiness through a form of minimalism.

Personally, I felt that the movie focuses too harshly on the extreme ends of both styles of life and as a consequence suffers to establish a connection with a significant number of the audience. We have already been informed of more attractive, modern and hygienic ways of living that preserve the ethical concerns of a climate progressive. I think this film forgets that up until we reach the portion of the film that focuses on Denmark. I think the cohousing that exists in Denmark most accurately represents the kind of living circumstance that would be attractive to me. I think it is important not to extend what we're talking about by climate awareness to far to other aspects of life.

The film “Happy” was really interesting and eye opening for me. The film brought up the fact that there isn’t a huge difference in the happiness people felt once they reached a certain level of wealth. The film established a difference between intrinsic goals vs. the intrinsic goals in life. On one side of the spectrum, there were these big business people who were unhappy in their lives. On the other side, a surfer who was experiencing joy everyday in his life. The difference was their motivations. The surfer had an intrinsic motivation in life  while the business workers had an extrinsic motivation- to make money. If we continue on this path of only craving money and status, were going to keep going in a cycle of wanting more and never being satisfied. It has to be a change in our whole American mindset. It can no longer be about ourselves, but about the well-being of the world. It seems like everything about us is one big competition. Like the tribe shown in the film, which their name translated “the original people,” they all worked in unison to heal each other and to provide for one another. They work as a collective. On the flip side, business men in Japan are literally working themselves to death and giving up time with their families to Make more money and climb up the professional ladder. It’s ironic that people living in developed nations have everything and more, yet they’re unhappy. Meanwhile, people living with barely any modern technology seem to be happier and understand human virtues a lot better. I liked the idea of a country not measuring their gross national product but their gross national happiness. That is the mindset we should have as a nation, collectively. Its clear that when you have an intrinsic motivation and goals, you are a lot happier and therefore, have a bigger purpose in life. Imagining a world where  everyone works collectively with genuine intentions to make it a better place for themselves and future generations seems like some far fetched utopia but I hope one day we take steps toward that. I just hope it happens at our own will and not because we are forced to do so.

Going off of what you said, I really enjoyed this week's film. The film was indeed eye opening and made me pause and take a look at my own life and happiness. One of the parts I found the most interesting was the pie chart that showed 50% of our happiness comes from our genes, 10% comes from our circumstance, and the remaining 40% is up to us. I didn’t realize that 50% of happiness is genetic and I was taken by surprise. Going back to what you were saying, I think wealth plays a role in the 10% circumstance piece of the pie chart. We can’t say wealth plays no role in happiness but the role it plays is definitely small. Intrinsic v. extrinsic goals do indeed play a role in happiness. I think we live in a country/society where people are concerned with wealth, image, and status, all of which are extrinsic motivators. We can see this due to the fact that some of the wealthiest nations have some of the highest rates of depression. People in countries like Denmark, however, seem to be happier. Citizens in Denmark have intrinsic goals and live with a sense of community. I found the co-housing in Denmark interesting as before I saw how much the people being interviewed loved it, I thought it was odd and undesirable. 
 <br><br>

Now speaking about the businessmen in Japan, I was devastated while watching that portion of the film. I was so unaware of how unhappy people were in Japan, that I had to rewind to listen to the quote “Japan is the least happy wealthy nation” over again. It was sad to see that there are people being worked to death. The film showed people who looked absolutely exhausted and when they went home they didn’t have time to be with their families. Family being one of the important keys to happiness, it is important that people can spend quality time with their loved ones. The idea that you said, measuring gross national happiness instead of gross national product, would be amazing. Countries should be pusing for good mental and physical health for their citizens instead of competing to be the wealthiest and most powerful.

I really enjoyed watching the documentary “Happy.”  One of the most important takeaways from the documentary for me was that 50% of your levels of happiness is genetically determined and 40% is from intentional activity. This means that a significant portion of my levels of happiness can be changed based on my own actions and choices. Therefore, I can definitely change the level of my happiness. The documentary touched on the idea that people that focus more on the intrinsic goals of personal growth, relationships, and the desire to help, over the extrinsic goals of money, image, and status, are happier. I have personally seen the effects of changing one’s goals. I definitely feel happier focusing on helping others compared to when I am worried about my image, status, and material things. I have also recently really shifted my perspective on my life and decided to try to be more positive and I have definitely seen a significant change in my level of happiness. Therefore, I agree that it is very possible to change and choose to be happier through taking different actions. I was also not very surprised to learn that once basic needs are met, an increase in wealth does not mean an increase in the level of happiness. This is because oftentimes people that focus on wealth tend to fall into the concept of the hedonic treadmill where one is never satisfied with what they have. This constant pursuit for more wealth and more material goods is stressful and never ending. I think it was pretty interesting to see why co-housing is such a great option for people in Denmark. The relationships and bonds formed through co-housing seem to be very beneficial and great for people.

I too really enjoyed watching the film “Happy” for many reasons. I thought the fact that there were so many great takeaways from the film made it so resonating and powerful as its message of exploring how people seek happiness made me really reflect on how I look for happiness in my own life. One of the many takeaways that I found especially inspiring was the section of the film that focused on the co-housing in Denmark and the many positive gains that came from such a structure. Listening to the woman who they interviewed as well as the kids in the community talk about the environment was inspiring as they seemed like they were truly gaining an enriching and positive experience through being able to spend more time with other people and build relationships while parents could also spend time with one another and spend more time with their kids due to the benefits that co-housing systems create. The benefit of not having to cook every night when you get home as the community eats together and they rotate who cooks seemed like such a perfect system and it made me realize how much potential there is to improve one’s own happiness by exploring these different methods of promoting happiness. The statistic that you mentioned about how approximately 50% of our happiness levels are set by our genes, while our circumstances only account for 10% of our levels of happiness and the other 40% is accounted for by intentional activity struck me as well. This statistic states that although everyone is different and has their own ranges of happiness, 40% of our happiness is determined by our own actions which is not only encouraging but inspires me to actively seek out some of what I have seen in this film to improve my happiness and the happiness of those around me. The film hinted at then end how happiness is not an individual endeavor but is interconnected among society and I believe this is an extremely important point as we realize that our connections with others and actions are what create happiness and we can use these interactions to help and impact others which would create a positive loop of happiness and community as cliche as it sound.

Before watching the film "Happy", i had a pretty similar understanding of what being happy should actually mean. I know that our American culture has a very strayed definition of happiness which revolves around success and money and that other cultures are more grounded in the real pleasures of life but that is something that has been built in our society for hundreds of years and while that does have a lot of negative effects, it is also what has made our culture one of the most advanced places which is something we can't deny being proud of. While yes people who do not have money or have to work way too hard for it are unhappy, we all know the kind of society it is and know that there are other places that have different values that may be more fitting. it is also possible to live a happy life and not be rich in America as long as you know what you really want and strive for it. That's unfortunately just how society has been built and it does create happiness for a lot of people in it too so it's more of a personal choice to be a part of it or not because i do not see it changing anytime soon due to the fact that it has become the base for our society. You cannot force or change someone's happiness for them it has to come from a desire within to make things better and a lot of people arent willing to make that change for themselves. 
 <br><br>

It is hard to change a wolrds view on something like this when there is so much importance placed on money by the "important" people in the world. It is also hard to come to grips with the idea of admitting you are unhappy and changing your whole lifestyle into something different that most likely has less of a direct appeal to the normalized idea of a good life. The solution lies within the people who are unhappy to change it for themselves. We all have to be accountable for our own actions and feelings and make changes that are necessary for ourselves because we do not have leaders anymore who will guide us in that direction.

I lived briefly in a different country and the story in "Happy" about the family that convenes every week really reminded me of my own family. We did not live in a swamp but we did gather weekly to spend time together. Perhaps it is because I was younger but my life did seem just like the one in the movie, and I remember being happy. By comparison, life in this country seems exceptionally hectic, with everyone apparently set on their track to success and not taking time to appreciate their life, much like the example of the overworked Japanese culture shown in the movie but maybe not quite as extreme. However, although my previous sentences may have made it seem so, I don't think that my life is necessarily drab. In an environmental sense, yes, my life is not ideal but I don't remember my life being an exceptional environmental wonder then either. Not saying that being happy is bad of course, but I don't think being happy will inherently reduce your carbon footprint. The communal housing lifestyle showcased in the movie did show that one solution can take care of both problems, which is why it was the most interesting thing to me in the movie.

This was a very sweet film to watch. After watching it for a second time it still made me really happy, grateful, and inspired to try to make other people happy. This documentary was definitely my favorite of English 22 and still is my favorite in English 23. I really enjoyed the part about meditation because meditation is something I have been introduced to within this past year.  I thought this was very interesting how it can actually physically change your brain and has a payoff that is so significant. Personally, I meditate, three times a week in my yoga class during shavasana. We lay completely flat on the ground, hands by my side, and just let my body be still, my mind blank, and just take the time to restore my body. I really like doing meditation and think it does boost my mood and makes me keep on coming back to yoga. Another part of the movie that interested me was the very touching story of the woman who had gotten run over by a truck, but has pushed herself to continue living and still is so happy despite her past. That made me so incredibly thankful and let go of things that are so benign in the grand scheme of things. Another part that I found interesting is that Okinawans have longevity, As an Okinawan myself, I was surprised and thrilled to hear this. From my grandma and grandpa, I have witnessed the okinawan mindset and I can totally see why their way of approaching life can increase one's lifespan. My grandpa, a pure Okinawan, models the same mindset as the 106 year old woman interviewed in the film. This idea of flowing and doing tasks that you can just fully immerse yourself into will bring you happiness. My grandpa always told me "do not force yourself to do a career path or anything you do not want to do. If you do, you will not be happy, and that is most important."

I appreciate how the film “Happy” makes the connection between happiness and environmental protection. Our individual actions of living happily with less stuff not only benefits our planet, but we are also making the changes just for the sake of ourselves. When the film talks about the figures regarding factors that have an influence on people’s happiness level, I was very surprised by the significant impact of both our genes and the activities we do. According to the film, 50% difference in happiness is determined by our genes; 10% is based on our circumstances; 40% is decided by intentional activities. I have always known that physical activity can bring us happiness, just as I really enjoyed the moment when I played soccer and golf during high school. However, before I watched the film, I didn’t think of doing physical activities in novel ways as something that leads to happiness. Many people who participated in the Gorilla Run in San Francisco thought it was a lot of fun and wanted to do it again. Their faces filled with joy very well fit the description of “flow” in the film. When people do things just because they like it, they feel fulfilled, forget problems, and forget themselves. This way of living, of pursuing intrinsic psychological needs, really helps establish an optimistic attitude for people to live a long and happy life. 

 <br><br>

Ken’s lecture gives us more factual information to support the claim that money doesn’t buy happiness. Switzerland, ranked as the 6th happiest nation in the world, has a greenhouse gas emissions that is ⅓ that of the US. Sweden, ranked 7th for happiness, has an emission that is ¼ of the US. Ken suggests that work load really does have an influence on gross national happiness. People in Sweden work for an average of 30 hours per week, whereas 40% of all Americans work more than 50 hours a week. This is also related to how the film talks about Japan (where it is common for people to over-work and ignore their own health conditions) and Bhutan (where gross national happiness is highly valued by the government and its people and is  considered a goal for development).

I completely agree with you. The film "Happy" creates a beautiful message by showing that you can determine your own happiness through personal actions. It then correlates this to our environment, and I love how the film underlines a connection between benefiting our planet, as well as ourselves.  And I really do believe this is true. A connection with our planet is a key component of our happiness. This film definitely made me think about the ways in which I take actions towards my happiness, and I realized that many of the things that make me happiest are things that connect me with my community and the world around me. This film made me want to be more self aware in my actions towards happiness in my life. I've always found Denmark interesting due to their being the #1 Happiest Country. Seeing the communal homes was amazing. It seems like a great place to live, especially if you've just moved.  It's a built in support system! 
 <br><br>

The film itself also indicated that a more minimalistic lifestyle leads to a happier lifestyle. All of the places in the film where people are they happiest, are also places where they. have the least amount of "things." They are living with what they need, and they are incredibly happy. Ken then backs this up in his introductions when talking about how money doesn't by happiness, as you quoted above. It boggles my mind that 40% of all Americans work 50 hours a week. I tried to think about what I do with the hours in my week and realized that as soon as I'm out of school, I may be working close to that, as my week is split by 25 hours of work and 13 hours of school (to afford a bed in a garage next year and help pay my tuition ). It's crazy how much we do for money. Overall this film really made me think about my outlook on life, and I enjoyed watching it,.


<br><hr>
I like your point that money doesn’t buy happiness. In Ken’s video, he mentions that Americans have been becoming less happy as we have been pumping more and more greenhouses into the planet's atmosphere. The five countries with the happiest people on the planet are Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and the Netherlands all have individual carbon emission that is on average about half of the United States. This proves that happiness is not related to greenhouse gases. This interesting film jumps from researchers’ conclusions to the funny and emotional testimonials of people from 14 countries. The main takeaway from this film is that researchers find that happy people lived better, are more productive, and lived longer. By studying people’s happiness level, researchers conclude that 50% percent of our fluctuations in our happiness level is due to our genes. Work, money, social status, etc count for 10%. And the rest 40% comes from daily actions. Before I watched the film, I didn’t know to live happily can do anything with climate change. Now, I realized that individuals living happily with less stuff not only for themselves but also benefit our planet. This reminds me of this week’s reading, Peter’s main motivation for reducing carbon emission is not directly reducing global emissions. His first reason to reduce his individual carbon footprint is that he enjoys living with less fossil fuel. He loves growing food, and he loves being home with family instead of away at conferences, so he doesn’t think it is painful to quit air travel or become vegetarian.

The movie "Happy" brought insight into what brings people joy.  I completely agree that is was a good move to connect happiness to the environment because most people that don't want the make the change from a heavy emissions lifestyle to low emissions one think there happiness will decrease dramatically with the amount they cut back.  I also was interested in the way the film talked about the connection between happiness and exercise.  I enjoy weightlifting and rock climbing and feel really good after I do any type of physical exercise.  I didn't understand that feeling was not just because I liked those activities, but because every time your exercise it activates the dopamine in your brain and makes you feel good.   It is insane seeing the workweeks in Sweden compared to the workweeks in America.  I think this is because of the different mindsets each country has.  In Sweden, it is as happy as possible, but in America, our goal is to be as wealthy as possible no matter the cost.  This ties in the week we spent on materialism and why it is what leads to happiness.  The statistics clearly show that we are not as happy as many places around us and part of the reason is that we are working ourselves to death in search of wealth that is not guaranteed to bring us joy.  I would much rather be like the average person in Sweden than the average person in Japan no matter the difference in money that they make.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film Happy, even though I had watched it before (I thought it was even better than the first time)!  I was amazed that according to the 2019 world happiness report, the US is ranked number as the nineteenth happiest country. Moreover, the report used the term “Easterlin Paradox”. The “Easterlin Paradox” is a recent term used to describe the current phenomenon in the US we're per capita income has more than doubled since 1972, yet happiness has remained roughly unchanged or declined.
<br><br>

While watching Happy, I kept thinking about work and how work and happiness are incredibly intertwined. For instance, in Japan working excessive hours is the norm and unsurprisingly, Japan is one of the least happy of the industrial nations. Moreover, in Japan, they even have a term to describe working to death, “karoshi”. Contrastingly, the average workweek in Sweden is thirty hours a week and only 1% work more than 50 hours a week. They also receive 25 paid vacation days each year and a one year paid paternity leave per parent. Unfortunately, when it comes to work, the US is more similar to japan than Sweden. In the United States, 40% work more than 50 hours per week, 20% work more than 60 hours per week. Working long hours can have detrimental impacts on our relationships, mental/physical health and levels of happiness. 

<br><br>

After watching happy, I did some research and was shocked to learn that a recent Gallup poll found that “61 percent of working Americans said they did not have enough time to do the things they wanted to do” there is a lot more time in the day than most people think. I was struck by the quote provided by Natalie Henderson, a pediatric I.C.U. fellow at the University of Louisville Kosair Children’s Hospital at the end of the opinion article titled, The Busy Person’s Lies. Henderson stated that: “time goes, no matter what you do. I’m covetous of the time I have. I want to make sure I use it more wisely.” It is foolish to think that time does not continue to pass by, therefore our only option is to utilize our time to the best of our capabilities and prioritize our time on activities that provide us with a sense of meaning, engagement, and pleasure.

After reading your comment, I came to the conclusion that time worked and happiness are inversely related. Obviously, in most parts of the world people need to have a job to feed themselves and have a roof over their heads, but working excessively in countries like the United States or Japan results in dissatisfaction among many employees. I think it is good for people to work in fields that interest them, but even people who really enjoy their job and work too many hours takes an emotional toll on them. 

<br><br>
I think that happiness, workload and education levels of people in Scandinavian countries are interdependent upon each other. There appears to be a strong positive correlation between happiness and education in countries like Sweden and Finland and I think those two things affect one another. Because of the outstanding education system these Nordic countries have, people there make strong efforts to reduce carbon emissions which in turn reduces people's consumption-related desires, limits working hours, and allows people to focus on priceless things such as relationships and passions. Contrastingly, people living in more unhappy countries like Japan are conditioned to work as hard as possible and make as much money as they can in lieu of spending more time making and strengthening relationships for example. The opportunity cost for working more to get more money far outweighs the consequences of spending less time working and more time building a stronger community.

I think the issue is more nuanced than "if you work less you're happier" - for one, go out to Santa Barbara and ask the homeless, ask the jobless, ask the unemployed if they are happy with their life. There's a balance to be struck, and critically, it should not be imposed from the heights of the C-level suite, but rather by the worker whose social safety net lets them ask the question "do I really need to work this additional hour?" and lets them prioritize their own wellbeing. That is the true endgoal - to free people to pursue happiness without costing their own life.

Watching the film “Happy” made me thankful for all the things I have in my life rather than wishing it to be something else. This film gave me a different perspective on the small things in life that could potentially make me happier if I just gave it the chance. Americans buy a lot of stuff in order to make themselves happier but they don’t use it which results in a pile of useless items. Sometimes, I think Americans are hoarders because they constantly want and buy stuff they don’t need and rarely use it for the item’s intention. As a result, it accumulates and accounts for their carbon footprint. 

<br><br>

I think American’s carbon footprint is a lot greater than anyone else’s in a different country is due to the fact that we believe the “American Dream”. The American Dream states that as long as you work hard, you will get the same equal opportunity as another and will be able to afford whatever you desire. This is clearly not true because I know so many people who work so hard at life but still receives minimum wage. I think to a certain extent, money does have an influence on people’s happiness but I also agree that after a certain amount of money, it doesn’t have that much of a difference. With more money comes the mentality that you could buy anything, resulting in a lot of unused items left in a storage box. This equals an increase in carbon emission and this is not good for the atmosphere. I like how Ken always mentions the Kardashians because they have so much money and they really do spend it on unnecessary things. They rarely re-wear the same outfits to a function and don’t even know how much carbon emission is released into the atmosphere just to make that outfit.

I also felt very appreciative for all I have after watching this movie because it made me realize I have so many positive things in my life. The part of the movie which was very eye opening was when the rickshaw driver in Calcutta had the same levels of happiness as the average American. Happiness is not money or any materials we can own. Happiness is all about positive attitude and surrounding yourself with positive people. I found it interesting that our circumstances only contribute to 10% of our mood because that 10% seems to be what a lot of people focus on. I think the concept of the "American Dream" has done our country more harm than good. We constantly are chasing more and more wealth, which leads to a life of complete dissatisfaction. I really enjoyed watching this film and seeing people who were not as well off genuinely happy with their lives and focused on the important things. Not only would letting go of this materialism make us happier people, it would significantly help the climate. In the past year I have been focusing less on items like clothes, shoes, and materials and have actually found a lot more happiness in my life. I also enjoyed seeing how people all over the world valued happiness because I think despite everyone's different culture, the people tended to attribute their happiness to strong community and family, experiences, and focusing on having a positive outlook. None of them mentioned money, which should really demonstrate to us what is truly important.

Hi! I think I always used to look up to people with money because they have so much money to do whatever they want and they have so much influence. With this film, some of them might be happier with their money, but a lot of people with money aren’t happy because they are constantly unsatisfied with something. I feel that because the American Dream taught people to not settle for less even if they are truly happy because of that so many people tried to achieve something that doesn’t even make them happy. For example, I know so many people who try to have a career they aren’t even interested in but that job pays well and because the world revolves around money, they feel powerless without money. I think this is sad about society because no one thinks they are truly happy unless they have that amount of money that is considered “rich”. Through this film, I realized so many things that make me happy even if it’s not money and I am thankful for that.

I really enjoyed the film, "Happy". It made me think of a story my hometown philosophy teacher used to tell, where someone who was wildly successful in the U.S., collecting wealth and belongings, but he wasn't happy. He visited a friend who was a farmer in Taiwan, and saw how joyous and glowing he was. He asked what the secret to happiness is, and his friend said, "To eat well and sleep well." If you can fulfill your basic needs in a hardworking and self reliant way, you will feel successful and complete, and your whole life will flourish. You'll be more confident in interactions, and more connected to those you work and live with. It's really unfair that in different parts of the world, people are almost forced to do whatever everyone else does. The way your parents lived will likely be the way you live. It's very difficult to leave society with your family and become a tiny farmer with your own energy and water sources: how would your children get educated, or seek medical help when necessary? This is why we started participating in society, but now we're in a place where we can no longer live a simple, happy life free of corporate interests.

Within the film ‘Happy,’ the ability to achieve what it means to be happy is visited repeatedly through the endless stories shared. Introduced initially is the idea of motivations and how these affect our actions. Within the accounts shared, many of the individuals find that it is possible for one’s true happiness to be maintained despite what’s introduced in their lives. In this constant search for the ‘pursuit of happiness,’ just as that of the American Dream, the continuous cycle one can fall into is in fact dangerous. Commonly associated with this ideal are monetary success, as well as image and materialistic goods. In any effort of chasing this achievement, more greenhouse gasses are emitted, through a continued rise in consumerism, as well as the ability to achieve what is viewed as success. This often includes the ability to travel from country to country, or city to city, often emitting a significant amount of CO2, when traveled by car and/or plane. This also includes our homes and the extent we may go to to acquire even more money. Often of which have been more so by the rise of social media and the ‘extrinsic’ values supplied by such values.

I feel like nowadays it’s so hard to be happy. There are so many more expectations and responsibilities and it’s hard to meet all of them while maintaining good mental health. Sometimes, I get so fixated on material things and new things that I forget what really matters. I enjoyed watching this film because it really put my life into perspective. I am always stressed about how I can get the newest thing or do the next best thing to be happy, but it really isn’t that way. I feel like we have separated ourselves so much from the natural world, and it’s really a good way to get a breath of fresh air and be happy. We get so easily fixated on things and feel like we need them to live, but that’s really not the case. Personally, it’s so easy for me to get caught up in things that don’t really matter. I tend to forget about what really has value and what’s important. But this movie helped me realize that there are more important things like family and just living a content and peaceful life. I hate that we associate happiness with excitement, because although it is a good thing, I think that real happiness is feeling at peace and comfort.

Talking to a friend from Spain recently, I started thinking about a lot of the stuff brought up in this movie and in Ken's video. He had just moved here for school and was shocked by the huge emphasis Americans place on "being productive," resulting in so much time spent alone. He told me about a typical day for him in Spain, which was one spent almost entirely with family, neighbors, and friends. After visiting family in Germany this past summer and seeing a little bit of Europe, I could completely agree with him. It is interesting how vastly different life in America is versus life in Europe. In Europe, people go out all night, they eat longer meals, they drink coffee in the afternoon together, they wake up together and go to sleep together and, at least to me, it seems like they do MORE. So why do we label ourselves the "productive" ones? Is this all some sort of Puritan influence telling us, still, to work ourselves to death and wait until we are in Heaven to be happy? 
<br><br>
What are we really accomplishing with all of this "work?" I feel like throughout high school, I strived to work harder than anyone else. I would wake up at 5 am almost every morning to do homework, go to class, come home and do more homework... I think it honestly came from a fear of being told I was not doing enough. I felt that if I worked hard enough, no one could ever criticize me for making mistakes. Looking back now it seems silly to put all of that effort into high school classes, but at the time, it felt so serious. I don't want to look back at college and wonder why I was so fixated on, or obsessed with, getting work done. Of course school is important, but I think we lose sight of the important part of school, which is learning itself. Besides for that, we should prioritize building connections to the people and places around us. I'm thinking about the Japanese family shown in the film, and comparing it to my friend's family/community in Spain. It is obvious who is happier, and why. 
<br><br>

I liked this film because, as Ken said, it is definitely worthwhile for Americans--who are responsible for some of the largest emissions--to stop and think about what really makes them happy. In order to do this, we will need to slow down. Meditate. Look at the nature around us, and think deeply about what we want and who we want to be. It is absolutely necessary for each person to reach a certain peace within themselves before attempting to create cultural changes.

After watching the film "Happy", I figured out people could be satisfied and fulfilling not only by consuming things but also other better ways. It is undeniable that money is something could represent a person's status and it could also satisfy people's demand. However, it is not a good way to pursue happiness. People cannot get true happiness from it. Instead, having the love and support from others around you is great motivation and makes people happy. I found out it is quite interesting to learn about dopamine, the chemical which releases happiness.

When watching "Happy", I was almost confused as to why it was included in the environmental curriculum, because at first glance it seemed to have nothing to do with the climate crisis at all. But after reading, I realized that there is a strong correlation between the concept of "happiness" and our impact on the environment. I find them very interesting to talk about the statistics of happiness. It's like 50% of happiness comes from genes, and you really can't change. This means that everything on TV and all the products that are currently pushed to our faces each day account for a high proportion of what we consider to be happiness. If we all spend more time focusing on ourselves, the best thing we don't have to buy or do will make us happier. In today's modern age, it is a general trend to see many people associate physical/tangible objects with their overall well-being. With the popularization of consumer culture and the demand for expensive, large and luxurious items, it is generally believed that their items can bring them happiness. These ideas lead to making more things, and making more things only leads to more waste, and ultimately to long-term damage to the environment. I think it's important to include this video in this course, because all of us should learn to understand that we don't get happiness by how much or how much property we have, far more than just owning property.

Being healthy makes me happy. I still have a long ways to go, but a lot of my friends are vegan and seem really happy with that choice. That's going to be me someday. It feels good to do good. Items have the power to make people happy for a temporary amount of time. Consumerism definitely does more harm than good on the larger scale. I think humans are slowly moving in the direction of realizing that happiness is much more than owning property and having a lot of money. In these odd times, I'm definitely starting to realize that there's more to life than that.

I liked that the film "Happy" showed the different lifestyles in other countries to contrast what American lifestyle promotes. Clearly, even though American citizens have more material goods, this does not necessarily translate to satisfaction with life. I was surprised that the top 7 happiest countries (despite having to use more energy because of the colder climate) emit much less greenhouse gases than the average U.S. person and that emissions are even lower in warmer countries-- it really puts the materialism and consumerism that the American Dream is based on into perspective. There is nothing that makes us so different from these other countries that we cannot adopt a similar lifestyle. It would benefit us mentally and the planet as a whole in the long run anyway. I think this film was particularly important for us as students because of how easy it is to get swept up in stress from school and the fear of failure. We should not be treating life as a race for money, rather, we should be more concerned with our happiness.

I often struggle in trying to argue the benefits of Bernie Sanders' democratic socialism to my dad, who is a strong proponent of capitalism and the private sector. And I see where he's coming from: I listened to a Freakonomics podcast yesterday that discussed the approximate economic impact of Sanders' policies, if enacted exactly as he campaigned them. According to Casey Mulligan, if Medicare for All, universal child care, free public college tuition, etc. were to be enacted, the United States would see a huge slowdown in the national economy: GDP and consumption would fall 24%, real wages would fall more than 50% after taxes, and everything from employment hours to the stock market will fall (these are rough estimates by a Trump administration economist from the Freakonomics podcast: "408: Does Anyone Really Know what Socialism is?").
<br><br>

I heard that yesterday and I freaked out. That sounds terrible! How can we accept these policies that are going to push our economic growth back years and decades before us? 
<br><br>

But after watching Happy, I understand it now. The economic growth is the problem. We've chased it for so long and let the economy grow and grow, but at such a high cost. Millions of Americans can't afford to see a doctor, go to college, or even work a job because they don't have access to affordable child care. While Sanders' policies would cause a slowdown to the economy, it would also uplift lives and allow the economy to grow slower, but more equitably. It would, at the end of the day, make us happier. 
<br><br>

As the documentary showed, most people's goals involve being happy. If happiness is our end goal, then why do billionaires, big corporations, material goods, and capitalism even matter? If everyone just wants to be happy, then capitalism is the wrong way to go, yet many people don't seem to understand that. Money seems to be the key to everything, but if this country were to realize that we've been misguided, maybe we'll elect Bernie Sanders as president and begin to change the system that has made us richer, but less happy.

I do agree that there needs to be a better system within which we can implement environmental and climate crisis policies within our country. It is up to the politicians to make that happen, and I do believe that the people that advocate it need to have their voices heard.

<br><br>

With that being said, I do not think that Bernie Sanders is the person to get it done. You are right in the sense that he can help to promote socialism, and you are also right that Bernie Sanders can extremely devastate our economy if he implements the policies that he hopes to implement if he gets elected. However, in order to get policies through, it has to go through a political process in which a majority of the house and the senate can pass these laws. A president can do only so much in the sense that they can create laws, but they are sometimes non-binding, with no legal mechanism to implement it. To pursue climate change is to pursue unity; Bernie Sanders just does not do that. 

<br><br>

Bernie Sanders is extremely left-winged, and President Trump is extremely right-winged. However, the only reason why there has been some action in the way that our president makes decisions within our country is because the Republicans hold the majority in the Senate. This causes problems for our country because Republicans use Trump to get policies passed. However, our country is left in a huge divide. However, extremist views only divide our country, and Sanders does just that. 

<br><br>

Extremists look at opposition as the enemy, and in our country, that is not the way that we can get things done. Rather, we need a president who can go across the aisle and convince the “other side” to make progress and understand that this is not a partisan-issue, but a human issue. Yet, extremists bring party into the issue - more than a moderate candidate does - and it makes it impossible to make change happen within our government. 

<br><br>

In regards to the economy, I do not think that striving for economic prosperity is the issue. The reason that the United States tries to pursue high economic capacity is because they want to hold influence within the world. Ken’s examples of Sweden and Costa Rica are not viable since their political and economic system do not even come close to the way that the United States’ government and economic system operate. Yes, Costa Rica has a lower GDP per capita than the United States and they do a better job of improving their impact on the climate crisis, and yes they could be happier. However, both Sweden and Costa Rica do not go under the same scrutiny or hold the same power than the US. The reason that we are even having the conversation in the first place about the fossil fuel industry is because the US, if they choose to, has the power to shift the course of the climate crisis. However, if we did not pursue economic prosperity and moved to a socialist platform, our ability to influence the rest of the world and choose our own fate goes away. 
<br><br>


We think that the capitalist system does not work right now because of the implicit costs that it produces. However, our entire country is based on the “American Dream”, or the idea that people can come to America or live in America and, through hard work, can move up the socioeconomic ladder. Yet, socialism changes that. It takes away our right of choice and individuality. 
<br><br>


So, I don’t think that left extremism is the way to go. Rather, instead, focus on uniting the country under a common cause and figuring this crisis out together.

<br><hr>
I really think that it is so sad that many people can’t afford necessary things to live a healthy life. I really do think that people should have more time for themselves and their family but they can’t have that time if they have to work multiple shifts a day just to make ends meet. I do agree with you on that we need these basic necessities to be happy. The only thing that I disagree with is that we need all these extra policies to slow down the economy so that people could make enough money just so they can afford what every american needs. I think that we need to find a way to move the money to have efficient spending in the government. The two key words are efficient spending. If we had efficient spending in our government maybe we would be able to give everyone affordable childcare, doctors, college etc.
<br><br>

You asked why big corporations, material goods and capitalism matter. I think that it doesn’t matter as much as people say it does. Yes I do think that we need it in order to have trade and bring money into our country but I think that people are confused on what makes us happy. It is so engraved in our mind that we need physical objects in order to make us happy. It is all over the media that we need the new and improved whatever it is in order to be happy. How they said in the film that about 10% of what we have makes us happy. Materialism makes us happy but not for a long time. Yes happiness is the end goal for all of us. Our parents do the most in order to make us happy even if they are not happy.

<br><hr>
I really like how your thoughts changed on Bernie's policy after watching this film. I doubted it before (I still somehow did) since I see a huge economic investment on almost everything if what he proposed were to be effective. But this documentary provided me with a new perspective to see the costs. I like how this film was rich in scientific data, solid analysis provided by researchers and scholars, and evidence of countries from all over the world. It not only explains why but also how to be truly happy with our lives. And I find those five points (Play, new experiences, friends and family, doing meaningful things, appreciation) convincing as I increasingly experience the joys they bring me. I was many times worried about if I am going to have a decent job and salary in the future. And lots of people around me have talked about the money they want to make each year. After taking this class, I am so much relieved and less worried and concerned about the money and materials. I don't plan to have a large house. I don't plan to own much stuff. I don't even want a car, if possible. Instead, I find that personal/inward growth and helping have so much more value to offer. I can become an activist and make a tour speaking and influencing people to make a change. There are just so many things that won't cost much money but worth people to experience, be genuine about, and be genuinely happy. On the other hand, it just connects with the previous lectures we had on materialism and stuff -- how the media and advertising are shaping our values and consuming our attention. I am glad that I am out of this prison. 
<br><br>


Lastly, I think if Bernie people really want to win this selection, maybe they could try to approach from the perspective presented in this film. Instead of forcing them to focus on what they can get and turn people away by what they will lose, they could remind people of the things that are truly important to themselves. People may find the things they think are gonna lose don't actually matter that anymore.

Happy was a very enjoyable film, I felt relaxed throughout the film and just took in all the experiences from different families in how happiness was measured. I will show this to my brothers when I return home because I feel like this film exposes how having so much ‘new stuff’ does not mean you will be happy. My younger brothers, like many American kids, think that if they get a new toy or new iPad, etc. they will be happier. Not just kids, everyone else can also learn something from this film. One of the stories that stuck to me was Koroshi and the Japanese family. I was familiar with the Japanese work culture since I had some Japanese teachers in high school who explained they came here to get away from that culture because it is normalized. Koroshi refers to the Japanese dying from being overworked or committing suicide due to work pressure. 
<br><br>

It reminds me of the mindset we have here of needing to be productive to feel good about ourselves. The idea of working more will lead to success and then you will experience happiness, instead of being okay with the idea that we need a break sometimes and it is ok to relax. The death in the Japanese family was sad because they were so young with their daughter wanting to spend time with the father but due to work he never had time. It makes me wonder if this is related to Japan’s low birth rates; young people are too busy working that there is no time or incentive to have a child. 
<br><br>

In contrast to Japan, Sweden sounds like paradise. The statistics were shocking but amazing because I had connected happiness with the number of things or money one has. They were the 7th place country with the happiest people even though their average per capita of emissions is ¼ of the United States capita. They have smaller houses than Americans and lower emissions even though they live in a colder climate. Working just 30 hours a week with 25 paid vacation days a year sounds like a faraway dream to me. We always claim we are the best country and all but there are so many others that have a more sustainable and better lifestyle.

I enjoyed this film and especially appreciated the scientific approach that they took towards analyzing people’s happiness. I liked hearing about all of the factors that influence happiness, especially when they explained that the baseline level of happiness for each person is mostly determined by their genetics, which I didn’t know. It was also surprising to hear that only a small percentage of your happiness comes from your life circumstances, so people living in extreme poverty are as happy as the average US citizen. I really appreciated the uplifting tone of this entire documentary, and it was very pleasurable to watch. Some of the things they said, however, came across as a little preachy and condescending, rather than as helpful information that someone could use in their everyday life.  The line between offering advice and telling someone what to do is very thin, and I think at times, this film fell on the wrong side of that line and left a bad taste in my mouth. I also don’t feel that they provided very many concrete solutions to make people happier in their lives, which was frustrating. While watching the movie, it felt very outdated, despite only being made 8 years ago. They did not address the impact of the internet, technology, and social media on the happiness levels of people, which I would be very interested to hear about. The fact that they left out aspects like these made the film feel less accurate, as they did not discuss all the factors of happiness, meaning they did not accomplish the task that they set out to. But despite these criticisms, I still really enjoyed watching this movie.

The film presented information that we have heard before. We know that money does not create happiness. Well in some cases it does but most times it is temporary. The film does a good job presenting evidence that shows that money cannot buy happiness and how there changes in your lifestyle that you can do to achieve it. Such as, meditation, flow, sports, cohousing and others. 
 <br><br>
What really struck me was the scene in Japan and how it was the least happy industrialized country. It shocked me how they would really work themselves to death. They are working for the grave. I would see why they would be happy as they did not have as much family contact. I found it sad when in the video the daughter did not really recognize her own father because he was on a business trip. This is all because money and having a lot of it will make you happy or bring you happiness. They work but not get to experience it as they are too into work.

This might be one of my favorite films that we have watched in this class. Although it might seem like its on the more boring side, I think I liked it the most because I feel like Ken is finally addressing something I talk about a lot in my comments which is the idea of success. The climate crisis has opened my eyes a lot more and has me really starting to think about what I want to do with my life. I've been stuck in the mindset of thinking that success is getting the best grades and the highest paying job. Slowly but surely the issues that are being brought up in the climate crisis are making me question an idea that I've had for a large part of my life. In that way, I guess I'm sort of thankful for the climate crisis(like not really but kinda I guess)??? Why am I going to spend 12 years going to schools that will put me in debt for a big part of my life and then get a job with a lot of money that I'm not sure I like very much but maybe I do because of the money? And the biggest issue for me with feeling success comes from money and also being environmentally conscious is that if you do care about your carbon footprint you really wouldn't be spending that much money. You wouldn't buy a car, a big house, fly frequently, or consume a lot, so I don't really see a point in wanting a job just for the money if you care about the environment. This leads me to my next problem which is a big factor in my lack of happiness currently, I don't know what exactly I want to do.  I do feel very passionate about certain things, especially the climate crisis but I'm having a hard time figuring out where I should direct my energy and what kind of career I should pursue with that in mind. This situation definitely lowers how happy I feel but I am lucky to have a lot of family and friends that support me. The people of Okinawa were so amazing to watch and it's amazing that even after their hardships from WWII, they still find love and gratitude in their hearts. I hope one of the major things that comes out of the climate crisis is a better sense of community and understanding, not just in the U.S. but around the world. I hope we can all learn to strive for true happiness.

I think it is important to change the way we measure success, our society places a lot of emphasis on 'having' things like you mentioned in your comment.  It is imperative we realign our economy in such a way that we prioritize ethical living in all aspects of our life. I am constantly revaluating my own life decisions and wondering how I can live more ethically and how I can lead a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. 

 <br><br>

I also admired the people of Okinawa's bright outlook on life especially in the light of their struggles and we should work to foster that outlook of life here in the U.S where our pessimism and negativity prevent us from enacting real change.

-       “Happy” was by far my favorite film that we have watched for this class. Sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong generation and place. So many of the people and cultures in this film made me long for a different life filled with a lot of less objects and a lot more people. I feel that people are so consumed with having the next best thing in order to compete with others and hold a high status when in the end, those things do not make you happy.
 <br><br>
-       I do indeed feel joy from giving back to others. Even if I don’t know if they “deserve” it or what someone would do with my money, giving back the time and effort to do so make me genuinely happy. Seeing others in need happy genuinely makes me feel content in many ways. Seeing the horrible things happening in japan right now and nothing being done about it is just sickening… what are these people working so hard for? Were all gonna die in the end, anyways right? Will that extra paycheck make your closer to God or whatever you believe in? There are so many things that people are caught up in nowadays that we just can’t seem to get out of it!!! School may seem like one of those things but its times like this that I am so genuinely pleased to go to school so that I can learn about these cultures, living situations, and people who are genuinely good to others.

I totally agree with you, this film has also been one of my favorites of the entire class. What I enjoyed so much about this film was simply how inspiring it was. It really is crazy to see and realize the difference between what makes people happy, and how the most simple things really do mean those most to some people, while for others, they are always worried about something and never just content with what they already have. I won’t lie, I am guilty of this exact thing, which is the main reason this film was so inspiring to me. I really do feel the society we live in today, especially as young adults in America, theres so much pressure from the media and just the people around us to constantly want more, whether that be clothing, cars, houses, or just money in general. This film depicted a completely different society than what I’m used to, and seeing what makes them happy was not only heart-warming, but also felt like a reality check. The film made me think of the saying, “you don’t know what you have until it’s gone”, because for a lot of us, including myself, the most important things in life usually go unnoticed due to us being concerned on other parts of life.
 <br><br>

Overall, this film ultimately should inspire those who see it to base their happiness on all of what they have, not what they don’t. It also helps depict that living a more simple life, that isn’t harming the environment, can be just as fulfilling, if not more, than the materialistic lifestyle so many of us live today.


<br><hr>
This film was also my favorite because I felt the connection with the interviewees. This encouraged me to step away from our consumer culture and gave me the motivation to practice living a simple life. I also believe making that change to live a simple life is difficult in our society, as everyone around us is consumed by the American way of life.
  <br><br>
Seeing the people who lived the humblest live happy made my heart content and made me feel selfish. We buy into our consumer culture and still always keep wanting more, longing for satisfaction. It is almost as if we search for this happiness through material items when instead it should come to us through intrinsic motivation.

<br><hr>
I completely understand how you feel. It is often overwhelming to me just how much stuff we have. We are surrounded by stuff, everywhere all the time. I loved the opening of the movie, the man who carries people around for his job explains that he is happy doing his job because he gets to help people - no matter if its raining or not, he remains happy becuase he is helping. 
  <br><br>

I think it is important to note that like Ken said, obviously if you are extremely poor like a person trying to raise a family in the United States that money would make you a happier person. But what is key to note is that studies have shown at a certain wealth point, the happiness that stems from monetary gain significantly depletes. This fact is especially important to note in this day and age where we idolize influencers who go on hauls and own 10 cars and purchase mansions. But what is key to realize is that so many of these influencers now have mental health issues stemming from this perpetual consumerism and competitive spirit to have the most and the best stuff. And thats all that it is to them - stuff, because they don’t ultimately need that 10th car or that 2nd home. I can’t imagine coming from a place where I constantly felt the need to have bigger/more stuff than everybody around me. 
  <br><br>

I think your comment is important becuase you emphasize how money wont bring you closer to any of the internal and emotional connections you have with things that matter to you. You put religion, personal connections, school, behind you in the face of having stuff. This stuff does not build these relationships, but it has shown that this stuff and this money can destroy these relationships.

I find it extremely interesting that serving others is a universal action that allows people to find meaning and purpose. As you said, you feel joy to give back to others, and I also feel joy when I give back too. I think part of the reason I gain happiness from helping others is because I am a Christian and the Bible has multiple verses that guide me on how to serve. Instead of indulging in worldly things, people should serve one another humbly in love, and be stewards of God’s grace. I know that the earth is not my home and that the things of this world (money, careers, goods, etc.) have no worth because I cannot bring them with me when I die. I’m not saying that those things are not irrelevant, but that it would be wrong to idolize them. Money will come and go, my career will come and go, and material goods will come and go, but the love God has for his people never changes. I know many people may not share this view, but the best thing I can do is to share how my Christianity has radically changed my heart and shifted my focus on what truly matters, my relationship with myself, others, and God. 
   <br><br>

To answer Ken’s question, I think making the changes discussed in this course would allow people to become happier in the future. Sweden, Denmark, and The Netherlands are examples of that. They’re much happier than the United States, and only contribute to a fraction of greenhouse gases. As I stated above, I am not focused on trivial things, and because of that, I have decreased my carbon footprint, even though it is probably a small decrease, it is progress. If more people were to also shift their focus off material goods, then their carbon footprint would also become smaller. I don’t need a nice car, a large house, or need to consume animal products to become happy. Nobody truly needs those things, however, to make those changes spread to everyone, then people need radical transformation of their hearts. I found mine through my religion, but others would have to find what that is for themselves.

Unfortunately, people do like to compete with others in order to prove to themselves that they live a better life than others. It is true and happening in every corner of this world. I agree with you that giving back to others is a form of happiness and joy. We cannot keep an eye on them, and their business is not my business; we just need to do things that we will not regret our genuine heart, despite the fact that they deserve it or not. We just need to know we are doing the right thing to make ourselves and people who love us happy. I am not a believer of God, but I think God's wishes are not like that -- to be fulfilled with desires and disguises. Religion becomes fake and that is how I feel it. My first host family in the U.S always takes me to church on Sundays, which I prefer not to go. The old Christian women dress so fancy and with all their jewelry on. And show off their new things. That was hypocritical and not just one church. Is this where we are going now? Even religion becomes unpure and fake. People should find true happiness in their lives with a limit line.

One of the first things that come to mind when seeing this week’s topic of our films dealt with happiness, the song “Pursuit of Happiness” by Kid Cudi came immediately to mind. The song’s chorus goes: 
   <br><br>

“I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
   <br><br>
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
   <br><br>
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
   <br><br>
I'll be good”
   <br><br>
 
I believe what Kid Cudi sings in his song as “I’ll be fine once I get it, I’ll be good” captures what the American misguided pursuit of happiness looks like. This idea of finally getting whatever it is you want in life (whether it be a partner, job, new shoes, clothes, car, etc.) you will be complete, happy, fulfilled. However, the catch-22 of it all is that you will never really be happy if your idea of happiness is attached to something that it is not of immediate access to you. This film made me think of how when I was in high school I used to think “When I get to college I will be happy because I will have made it.” Although I am happy in college, this isn’t what I had in mind. My search for a next source of “happiness” consists of me looking for a full time job. I know once I do find a job and begin working, shortly after I begin to look for my next source of happiness.



</p><hr>


<p>

Short answer to Ken's question is, no we aren't. First of all, the "happiness" is actually only the dopamine from our additions to the lifestyle we have. Which we grow tired of fast and always needed replacements that have newer fashions, styles. We need more updated versions of everything from our unrestricted consumer culture to keep things fresh and interesting. So we are not destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness, because no one is either genuinely getting happier or even pursuing happiness other than trying to satisfy our sick desires of wanting more. 

   <br><br>


Furthermore, the we are not destroying our own planet but merely ourselves, perhaps along with many other poor species that got to live with us on Earth today. The Earth has gone through worse situations that lead to more extreme environments. Extremely low oxygen level, meteor collisions, snowball earth etc. There has been 5 mass extinctions in history where 99% of the species on Earth including dinosaurs just died out, and today here we still see a thriving Earth, along with the "dying us". Our planet is not dying, it's just sick because we are like the cancer cells that keep taking and multiplying without restrains. It's going to be healthy again if we were to extinct because of climate changes done by us, just like us after having a fever. 

   <br><br>

So no, we are not destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness, we are just slowly committing suicides because some of us haven't evolve to learn not to be so cancerous.

While I disagree with some of the rhetoric used in this comment, what I think we can both agree on is that with regards to the connection between climate change and happiness, we are destroying ourselves just as much as we are destroying the planet by not recognizing what truly makes us happy and instead choosing to throw ourselves deep into vein and self-indulgent cycles of spending and acquiring more money as a means to try and stop the pain of life. One of the more interesting parts of this film was its refrain that joy and disappointment don't typically last long--in fact, the duration of all emotions is relative and depends on both our strength of will as well as our ability to move past negative events and create positive manifestations of happiness in our lives. So by spending our time on activities that will not make us more happy but will faster degrade the planet, we are killing both ourselves and the planet in a rapid and uncontrollable positive feedback loop.

The film, “Happy” was by far my favorite film assigned by Ken. It was a very wholesome and positive documentary to watch, I caught myself nodding and smiling with many of the things the people in the film had to say. A lot of interesting points were made regarding happiness and the different methods in reaching happiness. Last night I was having a conversation with my friend regarding happiness (what a coincidence considering I watched this film the following day) and we were discussing how we need goals and things to look forward to in life in order to have stability and happiness. It is so easy to lose oneself when you don't have anything to look forward to or a path to follow in life, this is why we need to create one, or multiple - even the littlest ones matter. The film even mentions the same thing; the narrator emphasizes how we should switch up our daily routines, whether that is taking a different route on your runs if you’re a daily runner (also a huge coincidence considering both me and my friend run every single day and say the same thing). The mention of constant physical activity being very important in relationship with happiness is something that I wholeheartedly agree upon. There was a surfing scene in the film in which the surfer says, “sports take you out of all of this,” I 100000% agree. As an athlete myself, exercising everyday, whether that is going on my daily runs or playing soccer, is one of the many things that I look forward to. If I am having a bad day, it is a great remedy for relieving my stress and worries. On the other hand, I am having a good day, it just makes my day even better and helps me perform better. There are a variety of sources that help bring a happy life, you just have to find it. The ending of the film makes a good note at this (the ending was also my favorite part of the film). The narrator ends the film off by saying how the things we love to do are the building blocks of a happy life - these things can vary from playing, dancing, singing, friends, family, new experiences, etc… and get this, THEY ARE ALL FREE - as the narrator points out.

I totally agree- this was definitely my favorite film of the quarter. it did a really good job emphasizing the power that interpersonal relationships and mindfulness have over material wealth, and the impact having a supportive community can have on their lives.  One thing I have really enjoyed about this class is the way it integrates so many aspects of life into the climate crisis and vise versa. It forces me to consider how many different parts of my life can play into my carbon footprint and my habits. Although this film doesn’t directly address the climate crisis, I think it links well to the ideas brought about in Being the Change, where Peter talked about how living a more holistic lifestyle with more family time and time to himself has greatly increased his quality of life and decreased his carbon footprint. I think this film was a good way of showing how many different lifestyles and people around the world can make small changes that make a major impact on their quality of life, and I think this could inspire a lot of people by having them consider if the people in the film can make such wonderful changes for their lives, why can’t I do that for the environment? I think it has the potential to be really inspiring for a lot of people.

Hey there thank you for sharing and I totally agree with your comment! Happiness also has to be one of my top documentaries watched in this class so far because it just gave you such a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart after watching it! I think this documentary did a really good job at addressing the question of how to be happy because this seems to be such a difficult and challenging question without definitive answers. Many also wrongly assumed that material wealth is the only pathway to happiness that the better cars you drive, the bigger houses you own, the more fashionable clothes you wear, and the more advanced technological products you have mean that you are a happier person. This documentary shows us that this is not the case as the opposite is often true: such people are often less happy compared to others who are less wealthy. Happiness is not solely dependent upon money and material wealth and social image; yes, it's true that these things are important and we cannot live without them because money, for example, satisfies our basic needs in life, which are essential to finding happiness. But we cannot forget that our relationship to our loved ones and our community, as well as things that we enjoy doing and are passionate about ultimately, make up a larger portion of our happiness level. In order to be happy, we need to recognize the central role of building close connections to our loved ones and our community while exercising our hobbies as merely focusing on financial gains would not bring us true happiness.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you! It is so so so easy to just get dragged down with the monotony of school work and other exterior sources of stress, but by taking a moment to simply meditate and think about the things that are going so well for you and life and all the great things you have accomplished so far does wonders in improving your mood! Also, finding that hobby that you enjoy so much and get excited and giddy thinking about is also so important for maintaining a happy state of mind. For me, that is rock climbing. I'm always looking forward to climbing different routes and trying different problems and techniques. It is a way to stay very active while also improving your confidence and skill. When I had injured my arm over winter break and couldn't climb for another 2 months, I found myself extremely bored and lacking purpose and so in response, I then picked up another hobby to occupy my free-time while I healed. My mood and happiness instantly skyrocketed and was back to normal. Moral of the story is, find that hobby that you LOVE and just do it!
<br><hr>
 I really liked your comment because my friends and I have had this same conversation about how we feel we need something to look forward to constantly. I find myself a lot of the time feeling like I need something outside of myself to determine what makes me happy. I too was an athlete in high school so I feel the need to be active as well and it really does boost my mood even when I didn’t want to in the first place. I’ve noticed throughout my life I constantly cling to the next exciting thing that will happen instead of living in the moment. I feel this is similar to thinking that material objects will increase our happiness because both at the end of the day leave one feeling empty again. This documentary definitely called me out on this bad habit. I need to spend more time doing the things I love which in the end will also make me a happier person. One example that I as well found myself agreeing with in the film was the man who continues to surf and that his biggest pride is that he can surf with his children. I want to be his age one day and still do the things that I love despite age. Even now I find myself giving up some things that I love and I tell myself excuses as to why it’s okay. I’m going to try and change this mindset that I have and one day I too will be a happier person.

<br><hr>
I agree with you a lot about how awesome this documentary was, it really made me think about how I am living my life and how I could improve it. Whenever I am feeling stressed out, I always try to go outside and do something fun to take my mind off of things, and I find myself feeling significantly better. Finding something you enjoy in life in my mind is the key to happiness, and is a great way to make significant improvements. Personally for me, i try to take time out of my schedule every day to do something fun or enjoyable, and I find it makes schoolwork a whole lot more manageable.

By drawing on interviews with positive psychologists specializing from neuropsychology to behavioral science, backed up with typical real stories from around the world at both personal level and international level, the documentary film “Happy” aimed at showcasing the public about “what is happiness” and “how to pursue happiness” from a scientific perspective. Generally speaking, it is an innovative and inspirational film, in that it successfully integrated scientific research findings of positive psychology into mundane entertainment, and informed several heating topics in the field, including flow, hedonic treadmill, intrinsic and extrinsic goals, social support, wellness, gratitude, religion, relation to nature, meditation, altruism, etc. This film also draw audiences’ attention to some problem when we pursuit of happiness.
   <br><br>
The fundamental composition of happiness shows that 50% is set point (genetically determined), 10% is circumstances (income, social status, where you live, age), 40% is intentional action (actions that you chose to do). So for the 40% is we can do to pursuit happiness. 
   <br><br>
The film introduces several ways to pursuit happiness. By living closely with nature, doing sports, or living with friends and family, etc. The formula of happiness is not the same for anyone, but the good news is that the things we love to do are the building blocks of a happy life.
   <br><br>
But in the modern city, people have a lifestyle to pursuit happiness. For example, in Japan, a lot of people died because they work overtime. They feel exhausted and don’t have time to have company with their kids. The way they pursue happiness is to work hard and make more money. But they lose the time to play with their kids and family. 
   <br><br>
I think we are indeed destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness. We think happiness is to make more money. But more money is not happier. We cut the trees to build a factory, we are destroying the planet because we think economic rise can bring happiness. But this is wrong. The way to find happiness is play, having new experiences, live with friends and family, doing things that are meaningful, appreciating what we have. These are the things that make us happy. The more things you have, the more everyone has.

"Happy" was such an interesting watch because it takes on a very emotional aspect of our lifestyle--it forces us to reconsider the way, as Americans, we choose to live. As Americans we love to think we find happiness in materialistic things, such as clothes or shopping. The film does a good job at proving that happiness can be sought after and be found in different places.The film’s audience is most likely casual viewers, as the different methods of achieving happiness covered were very broad and only covered in short segments, rather than in depth. The movie definitely appealed to me emotionally at some points, especially at the part where the girl who got run over by a truck talks about how she is finally happy. It made me really think about what I value in life and how my happiness is affected by that. The film does a good job at covering a variety of cultures throughout the world so I learned a lot about how happiness plays a different role in different parts of the world.

After watching this inspirational film and reading your comment, I completely agree with you. This film really does make us reconsider the way we live. We live in a world full of resources to us, but we take it for granted. We love to think of happiness through materialistic things like clothes and cars which isn't healthy for our world. It is inspiring to see people happy with such a simple lifestyle while many of us are unhappy with the many things we own.

I really enjoyed watching this documentary, and for me, the takeaway was that our main source of happiness comes from our connections with people. Like they mentioned in the movie, science has shown that the happiest people are those who have close and supportive relationships with friends and family. I am lucky to come from a very close-knit family, one who will always support you no matter what. My family is not religious, but my mom always says that family is her religion. It’s what makes her feel like her life has a purpose. Finding something that you are passionate about I think is a key to being happy. One quote that resonated with me from the film was “once you have basic needs met, more money doesn’t seem to buy more happiness”. So many people dedicate their lives to trying to make more money, be more financially successful, buy bigger houses, buy more things. While this is not only damaging to our environment, it is damaging to our emotional wellbeing. Once you get into the cycle of wanting more, it never stops. Like the theory of the hedonic treadmill suggests, you will never be happy with what you have. Even though the average income in America has increased over the last few decades, the average levels of happiness have remained stagnant. Happiness is its own form of richness that cannot be bought with money. It has to be worked towards, with changes in your life that focus on people and community, not things and money. In my opinion, our relationships with others is our most valuable asset, and I think this is something that many people have forgotten.

Skeptical about the "happiness" rankings.
   <br><br>
Happiness is incredibly subjective and these rankings reflect more an average level of content caused by a strong safety net (in the top 5 countries stated) rather than some sort of paradigm of differential consumption. 
   <br><br>

Plus, lets not forget that these countries (NL, Iceland, Norway, etc...) are capitalist countries and not the "socialist" utopias we think they are. These countries are "happy" because people live in stable situations, don't go bankrupt because they break a finger, and also because these countries are very culturally homogeneous. These are people who live comfy lives where they receive unemployment benefits, universal healthcare, parental leave (for women AND men), and don't go bankrupt having a child at a hospital. It's that simple folks. 
   <br><br>

And then you have countries like Sierra Leone where people barely emit any CO2 yet I guarantee that 95% of the people there are miserable.

The documentary "Happy" explores the idea of happiness (obviously...) and makes the convincing argument that economic factors and the accumulation of wealth have relatively little to do with overall satisfaction in life. I found this underlying theme to be quite comforting, as I continue to believe that happiness and satisfaction in life comes from success and from making and spending lots of money. Living in the United States, it is a goal/aspiration that we've been groomed to believe, and it is an unhealthy mindset that I still can't shake to this day. The documentary explored various countries that have much less economic success than the US, and yet they still pass us in terms of happiness. From the Brazilian surfer to the Indian rickshaw driver, it is evident that we don't need material gain as the key to personal fulfillment, but we do need passion for what we do each and every day and a mental/physical drive to seek out experiences that stimulate our mind and bodies. 

   <br><br>

Objectively, we have so much here in the US. We have an excess of things that we waste our money on and don't really need. This excess of stuff would make sense if it truly did make us happy, but it doesn't. So let's flip the switch. Let's reduce the amount of stuff we buy and utilize our time and resources for things that really make us happy. Not only is this beneficial to our overall well-being (and wallet), it's better for the planet. I found this film to be a good way to round out the quarter and the class. We've discussed all the ways that we as individuals need to change in order to reduce our emissions; we've talked about the social and cultural aspects of American life that we need to shift with the planet in mind; and now, we we've discussed how all these changes can ultimately result in happier, more fulfilling lives.

I really like the perspective of happiness this film has exposed me to. The bold and clear connection this film makes between happiness and appreciating the intricacies of life and how that’s distinct from modern american values. Today, commercials and media portray the images of superficial success achieved only by money and environmentally destructive lifestyles. I think it’s important to recognize that this image of success has been instilled in society’s culture and it’ll take more than just environmental reasons to drastically change the way people live today. Therefore, I especially like how this film demonstrates that material success comes at the expense of not only the environment, but also their individual happiness. In the pursuit of money, people can end up in a cycle of consumption while never becoming satisfied. This type of consumption has destructive and life changing consequences on the planet. Despite that fact, people may still consume thinking their present happiness outweighs the looming danger.

 This film puts things in a different perspective as it encourages me to think about what makes me happy and what I think will make me happy. From a young age I had a dream car which was a supercar. I remember thinking that if I bought that car, I would have made it in life. However, reflecting on that now, I don't think it will bring me as much happiness as I originally thought. Not only does a super car burn up oil and cause harm to the environment as incredible as its speed, it only a monetary milestone that brings no persisting value to my life. I

The film, Happy, was something I did not expect to watch in an English class focused on environmentalism. The feeling of happiness is a psychological, sometimes physiological emotion that is not often talked about nor thought about when discussing climate change or environmentalism in general, in my opinion. However, after watching the film and Ken’s video about the topic, it was rather clear that the state of emotions a person experiences on a daily basis is not, at all, directly proportional nor related to their socioeconomic status. Our society tells us that we are capable of reaching happiness only if we have certain things like a large house with a walk-in closet, the latest car model, a large family and a lot of money; we believe that these materialist ideas will add value to our lives and thereby make us happy. We trust these principles to be true because this mentality is constantly being fed to us as consumers. We have to come to the conscious that we live in a capitalist society that will manipulate our thoughts and actions to pursue economic growth although our contribution to the economy has a devastating consequence on the entire planet and longevity of the only place humans can inhabit. Nonetheless, once reached the pivotal moment of success and accomplishment that is measured with the materialist things owned, how come happiness felt; perhaps stress is felt in thinking about maintaining this new lavish lifestyle. For these reasons, it is not crazy to believe the fact that the US is not among the happiest rated countries in the world because our society leads us to believe these materialistic things will add more to our lives, whereas in reality, we have to seek inside ourselves for true happiness and contentment.

This film left me with, I'll be honest, a pretty depressing question: Am I happy? I mean, I'm happier than a lot of people I know. I'm not depressed. But am I happy? No. What things contribute to that? I exist in a society that puts capitalist worth above joy. I am more stressed than anything and have no time for creative outlets. Consumerism is most likely a huge factor.  I'd like to be free of that life...
   <br><br>
I would love to live in a communal housing community. The American idea of living alone sounds awful and lonely to me. My friends and I often joke about living in a commune and honestly? I am fully willing to make that a reality. That sounds amazing, sharing housework, cooking, cleaning, growing food, even raising kids together. I think that is how humans are meant to live. Together.
   <br><br>
I wish the US worked more like Bhutan and focused on national happiness over GDP. 60% wildland is such a beautiful thing to protect. However, some of the things they mentioned controlling seemed like a loss of personal freedom Americans would not take well to, like clothes.

May I and all of y'all find joy in family, friends, and community, not consumption.

I first thought about how wanting more doesn't really lead to more happiness whilst reading Thoreau. I didn't think too much of it and didn't really apply it to my life at the time. However, this film made me really think deeply about what I want to do with my life in order to achieve fullfilment and true happiness. When coming to college I deeply researched what I wanted to do with my future, I really prioritized making money over something I would actually enjoy. I thought about going into economics, which I'm so glad I didn't because I have no interest in it but I thought it would make me more money. 
   <br><br>
This film was very humbling and made me have less stress about what my future entails. The figure that once basic needs were met(at about 50k a year), happiness doesn't really increase is what did this for me. I've always been worried about my future and this is what provides me with the most stress in my life. I've thought deeply about my life after watching this film and I am more content on finding something that I want to do later in my life that I actually enjoy even if it doesn't make me much money. At the end of a movie they talk about how happiness is subjective and that we should all do what makes ourselves happy. While i'm not looking into living in a commune just yet, I am sure this film has made my view on life alter slightly and I will pursue what makes me and the people around me happy more than anything else.
   <br><br>
A look at different parts of the world taught me more than anything else in this movie. Specifically the African tribe at the end. They stick together and rely on happiness through eachother even though they have very very little personal possessions. We need to make a shift towards being content with less and by replacing that with personal relationships our population will be happier as a whole.

This film was one of my favorites of this quarter. Its exploration of what happiness is and how it is achieved is both captivating and thought-provoking. In our culture today, so much emphasis is placed on happiness through things. We’re taught that if we just buy more clothing, make more money, achieve “success,” happiness will follow, when statistically it’s known that this is not the reality. We’re taught to achieve happiness through competition: if we excel in sports or academically, if we make the most money, if we always get first place, we’ll be happy. The reality of the situation is that happiness comes from altruism and compassion and love and doing things we love, which is so far from the mutilated idea of contentedness that arises in our society. Further, this idea of happiness brings environmental destruction, when it’s so far from necessary; the hyper-consumerism and instant gratification of our society contributes to more production costs in the form of GHG emissions, deforestation, etc, as well as far more waste than necessary.
   <br><br>
The film breaks down happiness pretty simply: 50% is dependent on genetics, 10% on external factors, and 40% on intentional activity. This intentional activity comes in the form of doing things we love, compassion, altruism, and other things arising out of intentionality. The “recipe” for happiness is different for everyone--whether it’s through surfing, delving into community, helping others, or other intentional action. It made me really think about what makes me happiest, and how interesting it is that where I get happiness from won’t be the same as where everyone else gets happiness from. At the end of the day, it’s clear that the destruction of the planet in pursuit of some deranged version of happiness is not worth it, as it’s not how happiness is attained.

I agree with you. The documentary, Happy, demonstrates the value of happiness by exploring different countries’ lifestyles and interviewing several people with their unique experiences. For example, the scene in India talks about a poor rickshaw driver’s life. To him, happiness easily comes from the daily time spending with his family and neighbors and meeting the most basic of needs. In the Brazil scene, residents find happiness by doing some sports like surfing and rock climbing. Denmark as mentioned is the happiest country on earth; people gain happiness from free health care, high standard of living, and group living. Watching all these examples helped me better understand the sources of happiness that the film concluded in the end: playing good, having new experience, enhancing relationship between friends and family, doing things that are meaningful, and appreciate what we have now. What’s more, this documentary is extremely informative. It brought up that happiness is determined 50% by our genetic ranges, 10 % by our circumstances like income, social status, and 40% by the actions that we choose to do. This means money and status that nowadays most people pursue cannot lead them to greater happiness, and most happiness comes from people themselves.

The film Happy focuses on what it means to be happy and how it can be measured. The film shows us that although society makes us think that happiness comes from just materialistic objects such as money, that does not provide the most happiness. It is interesting to think that a portion of the concept of happiness comes from genetics and biological factors such as the chemical dopamine that induce the state that we know as happiness. I found interesting the idea of “flow” getting happiness, satisfaction from an activity usually a physical activity such as aerobic swimming that requires concentration and is a bit difficult. I really enjoyed that fact that this film got different opinions from different types of people on the idea of happiness. I do agree with a statement said in the film how it is im-ortant for the basic human needs to be met first in order to be happy, that is where money comes into play since in today's society money is needed to meet basic human needs like food, water, and a home but beyond that money may get you more things yet that doesn’t mean it will get you more happiness. I agree that although extrinsic goals which focus more on getting more stuff is at some level important, that intrinsic goals which focus on satisfaction within will ultimately give a person more happiness. I was also aware that in some countries work ethic is very strong, extrinsic goals and financial prosperity was a priority yet I was not aware of Japans’ problem with people working themselves to death. The story of Kenichi working himself to death told by his wife was very scary to me because it's something very common I think everywhere, some places more than others. There are several studies suggesting that stress can also lead to an earlier death or health problems. In today’s society I think people do not focus on being happy but rather on what things could make them happy such as a big house, nice car, being able to afford luxury items and etc. I had heard about Denmark's socialism, with its free education and health care, but it was insightful to hear more about it with things such as the cohousing communities. Which is interesting because something emphasises in the film that relates to happiness is close relationships one builds with family, friends and their community which leads to more happiness. From the islander people in Okinawa, Japan who unlike other parts of Japan live very long lives and one of the things they say contributes to that is their tight sense of community. 
   <br><br>
I agree with Ken, it is ironic how our pursuit of happiness for materialistic things that our society emphasizes will bring us happiness, but isn’t and instead is just destroying our planet. We are not just destroying our planet, but also making it so future generations are affected as well. I think it would be very sad for future generations to not know and see the nature and beauty of the environment because we are ignorantly pursuing things that aren't making us necessarily happy simply to satisfy our needs for a short period. I think that changing the concept in which happiness is thought about which can be seen in the film with things such as “flow” and intrinsic goals could change the way people go about their lives and could help society shift to a more eco friendly living style.

The documentary begins with a saying by Benjamin Franklin that “The Constitution only guarantees the American people the right to pursue happiness. YOU HAVE TO CATCH IT BY YOURSELF.” The definition of happiness is different for everyone. Someone thinks happiness is money and success, someone thinks happiness is family, and some thinks happiness is nature. 
   <br><br>
Based on Happy, happiness is composed of three main factors. Surprisingly, circumstance which is the factor I think influence happiness most, only accounts for 10 percent. Half of one person’s happiness is decided by innate genes. The last 40 percent happiness is from people’s intentional choice. It is beyond my expectation but makes sense. I think that’s why there are ‘optimistic’ people and ‘pessimistic’ people in the world. Though the range of happiness is mostly from our genes, it is important to find own happiness in our whole life. I really like the lifestyle of the surfer in the film. I agreed to him that people should not preoccupy themselves totally into the substances they owned and worry about money every day. Because you felt more stressed about these things and could not feel happiness. Do what you want to do is important. 
   <br><br>
In addition, environment plays an important role in healing people’s heart. In Happy, the mother who once disfigured was encouraged by her children and the horses on her ranch. She said that the horses are very healing to her. It is amazing that she become a happier person even though she did not own beauty like once.
   <br><br>
Another example which shocks me is the Japanese worker who died because of karoshi. It has been a normalcy that people always work or study for a long time. Working and studying seem to be the total of their lives. I still remember that one of my classmates in the high school insisted on coming to school even she had a high fever. Because she said that she was afraid that she lost her GPA if she did not come and catch the teacher’s progress. For me, I think it is too tired to live a life like that. Why we study and work is because we want to have a happy life in the future. But, if we are not happy now, shall we continue to do this?

What stood out to me the most from this film was the notion that nature induces happiness. This is truth for me and others that I've spoken to. Here in Santa Barbara we are BLESSED with the nature that surround us. I think that many students at UCSB take our beautiful environment for granted. I have found that taking a walk out by the lagoon, biking to watch the sunset and taking a run on the sands fills me with peace and happiness… and I'm not just saying that. Taking a look at the scenery all around us fills me with appreciation, and it brings me happiness. I think it's important for all of us to identify what it is in life that brings us happiness and we should pursue it.

That moment was really jarring to me in a film that contraindicated everything Amazon. I honestly felt like this movie was one of the most helpful and impactful films we've watched in this class in regards to climate change, even though it has nothing directly to do with climate change. I deal with intense depression, and having a film about happiness in a climate crisis class was a really powerful experience.

I don't think this comment will be super novel among the other 600, but I just want to say it anyway - this film does such a good job at recognizing and displaying so many things that I had to a lot of therapy to learn - just things like moving your body and finding flow states, being with community who cares about you and taking the rest your body needs. I think these are so important, and a huge cultural shift is necessary.
   <br><br>


Because even in university, which is all about personal development, these things are discouraged. Walden got a lot wrong, but one thing he nailed is that we work ourselves crazy college students aren't crashing and burning all the time because we're idiots, we're crashing all the time because we have insane workloads, immense debt, no community, and no rest or sleep. People don't fail at something systemically because they all aren't good at being humans, they fail systematically when the system is rigged.

Though I've seen this documentary before, it is still my favorite that we've been assigned to watch this quarter! I absolutely love how the film focuses on the important things in life, and truly emphasizes the importance of material value on one's overall happiness. While the entire documentary is filled with people of all walks of life who are inspiring, my favorite part of this film was when the filmmakers traveled to Okinawa, a country with a disproportionate number of citizens over 100 years old. I thought the sense of community was captivating, especially the scene which showed a group of small children running some type of race, while the elderly members of the village all gathered to greet them and celebrate them finishing the race. This is something truly unique to Okinawa because everyone is truly connected within their community. It seems as though everyone has compassion for one another, and for that reason, it's a very happy community despite Japan as a whole being one of the most unhappy countries.
   <br><br>
I believe that if as a whole, people began to focus more on intrinsic goals and values rather than extrinsic, our world would be one that is happier. Focusing on material consumption is not only bad for the planet from an environmental standpoint, but for the welfare and mental state of our global population. If we continue to exploit resources in order to produce more commercial goods, it’s possible that not only will our world become uninhabitable, but it's inhabitants will have no desire to try and fix it.

I loved this film as well! One thing that I loved about it was that it could be applied in many different ways. When watching this film at face value, there are key takeaways such as the fact that 40% of our happiness is within our control and that once our basic needs are met, more money does not equal more happiness – all valuable information that can be applied to our daily lives. But when considering this film was specifically chosen for a class about the climate crisis, a whole new perspective can be adopted. “Happy” emphasizes points made in other documentaries. It validates the idea that minimalism is fulfilling and a focus on “stuff” is not necessary for contentment. It solidifies the notion that fast fashion has a negative impact on us and others, especially considering the fact that having compassion and performing acts of kindness for others is a factor of our happiness. 

   <br><br>

I thought that the scenes from Okinawa were heartwarming too. Like you mentioned, the documentary said that Japan is one of the most unhappy countries, but that is a generalization. The community found in the small town of Okinawa conveyed that people are much more important than any product or achievement. While watching it, I took a look at my own life to see if I had as much happiness as they did. The people (especially the elderly) of Okinawa are great role models for us to see how we can implement a truly uplifting and compassionate community into our own lives. 

   <br><br>

Although it’s not directly a movie about the climate crisis, beginning to live with intention and a focus on intrinsic goals would, as an effect, help the environment and ourselves.



<br><hr>
I also really like that they show the scenes in Okinawa. I find their concept of the "icharibachode" spirit very inspiring - people become sisters and brothers as soon as they meet, and that people should never seek to cause each other harm. When a tragedy befalls someone, everyone in the village come out to help and share their pain.
   <br><br>

I do agree with you that it's not only important but also necessary for us to start focusing on intrinsic goals rather than extrinsic ones. It actually makes so much sense to me know. Money, prestigiousness, how others view you, etc are things that you can't always have control over, whereas love, connection, personal fulfillment can be cultivated through very simple actions like spending time with your loved ones, move around, play an instrument, paint, practice meditation, etc. 
   <br><br>

One really important thing that Ken mentioned was how we keep thinking that living a more eco-friendly lifestyle is something extremely difficult and unattainable, and involves giving up things that makes us happy. But evidence in Scandinavian countries shows otherwise. They manage live a pretty fulfilling life with low greenhouse gas emissions. So the important question is, are we gonna keep buying into this myth of productivity + material = happiness or are we gonna look to those who have been successful (at happiness) and start changing out attitudes and behaviors?

Ironically the film for this week, Happy, leaves the audience with a somewhat sad feeling.  It makes us realize how most people need money and material things to be “happy” instead of finding happiness in other aspects of life.  In the United States there is a popular notion that money/material = happiness yet we are 19th in the world for happiness.  Other countries who have better values obviously rank higher.  Most people in the developed world do not understand that there are things worth being happy about other than money.




</p><hr>


<p>
In the film Happy several different lifestyles were examined for how happy they made each individual. A reoccurring theme occurred showing that the less people were chasing after money and material things, the happier they seemed to be. For instance, a man who lives in Louisiana lives a happy life through enjoying the surrounding nature and spending time with friends he grew up with. The concept of needing more in order to be happy has caused most Americans to be consumed by the ideal life of making money and then spending it on the next bigger and better item. We have forgotten the joy that comes with simple, non monetary items, such as the relationships we build and appreciating nature. 
   <br><br>

Overall I would say our pursuit of "happiness" has created a society where we destroy the planet in hopes of finding happiness through consumption. We exploit nature's resources while emitting greenhouse gases in order to produce more. When we purchase a new item there's a temporary happiness tied to it that makes us feel like in order to have happiness we have to find it through consumerism. However, when someone finds happiness in everyday life, that happiness lasts much longer, as proven in the documentary. 
   <br><br>

Our false sense of happiness in purchasing has created a society detrimental to the environment. Although this film is not about environmental studies, the two subjects are linked. It is important for people to realize the value of things money can't buy. If we don't change as a society our toxic happiness will only continue to grow until the Earth can no longer support our habits.

I think that Ken had a n interesting correlation between less emissions and happier people. I think in America people believe that gaining more material things will lead you to happiness but with more things comes more emissions because everything has a carbon footprint. People in the US keep asking for more material things which is very bad for the environment and yet leads us to be less happier because we need more fulfilling or intrinsic goals so that we may reach true happiness. In the movie “Happy” scientists spoke about the fact that people with more things were measured for their level of happiness and ended up being more depressed and anxious versus people with less. After a certain point the change in happiness with more things is very small. So what we have to do as a community is realize this issue and change. Instead of looking to get more unnecessary things we should look for was to more towards achieving our more intrinsic goals so we may find true happiness in activities that fulfill us and by doing this we will also be doing a favor to our environment by reducing emissions.

Watching this film was quite refreshing for me personally as it was a pleasant reminder that my life doesn't necessarily need to revolve around how much money I make, how many things I own, or how much I achieve, especially as I'm stressing about final exams and my grades. While it's understandable as to why Americans have put material wealth on a pedestal, the American dream certainly isn't the only thing people should be chasing. Aside from the basic necessities that we as humans need to survive, the things that we have convinced ourselves that we "need" are probably things that have been portrayed as a necessity through media and advertisement that has formed American culture. The lifestyles of families and communities in other countries such as Denmark and Japan serve as proof of this fact. 
   <br><br>

I was also inspired to see how people like Melissa Moody and her family bounce back from tragic events to turn out even HAPPIER than before. It's truly a testament to how crucial intrinsic happiness is to how people find meaning in the life they lead.

This has been my favorite film shown this quarter. It is very applicable to the average American. Many students, friends, and family that I know personally struggle with lack of happiness. With ideals such as money buys happiness, many Americans can be focused on the wrong goal. 
   <br><br>

Like discussed in English 23, this American need for possession for happiness can do the opposite. The abundance of stuff is not only harmful environmentally, but also can lead to wanting more, and a feeling of never being satisfied. 
   <br><br>

The small stories of individual’s experiences helped create effective evidence for this film. My personal favorite anecdote was of the communal residence in Denmark. Here again we see a recurring trait in English 23. Communal living is not only environmentally efficient, but increases happiness. Living in the dorms, it’s easy to see the negatives and positives of communal living, but this video does a good job highlighting its benefits. 
   <br><br>

A recurring theme for happiness in the film is community. America is such an individualistic culture and that may not be in our best interest. Building relationships with people allows us to become happier, rely on our loved ones, and not carry the burden of existence ourselves. Being around this community helps us find purpose in life, and allows us to bring joy into other people’s lives as well. This is contradictroy to what is seen in Japan, a country with high depression and suicide rates. Japanese value hard work and material wealth, and as a result, see very low levels of happiness from its citizens. 
   <br><br>

It is depressingly ironic that Americans have been destroying their only home in pursuit of happiness, only to find that these actions have been causing their depression. It’s a sad, endless cycle; Americasns try to buy an idealized version of happiness, killing the planet, becoming more depressed, only to continue to purchase more, which makes them feel more empty. Americans need to snap out of this cycle and realize the ways in which people can truly achieve happiness.
   <br><br>

The film does a good job tying together everything we’ve learned in the class. The connection being made is that one can live environmentally friendly and become happier, despite what the media has pressurred us into thinking.

your point about how many Americans struggle with finding happiness is something I find more and more prevalent especially in the friend circles I’ve been in throughout my stay at UCSB. We tend to come here with the ideal dream of securing a degree that translates into a well-paying job. Be it for our own well-being or to provide for loved ones, that’s the common goal I’ve found we share. But, like discussed in this class, this need that is rooted in money can be detrimental in the end. 
   <br><br>

While I feel like pursuing financial security is in no way something bad, I think that we need to realize that some of our happiest moments in childhood were with the lack thereof. Wanting more and more when you’ve been happy with so little is an uphill battle. 
   <br><br>

Another point I agree on is just how important community and sense of belonging can be for happiness. On a personal level, I wasn’t really involved in anything past my high school friend group across video games when I first started college. And for the majority of my first year, it remained at just that. It wasn’t until I started hanging out with my future 2nd year housemates where I felt really invited to go out and do stuff. Ever since then, I’ve found a sense of happiness in being around others who share the same values, principles, & goals that I do. 
   <br><br>

The last point I’d like to touch on is how Fatima said the media has pressured us into a materalistic dependent form of happiness. It’s sad how much happiness is placed into owning a mansion, luxury cars, & overindulgence. While it’s hard to say that it doesn’t provide happiness, the pursuit of it is definitely punishing for those who struggle with delayed gratification, and in a society where everything is pushed to be “instant,” I feel like this is a likely cause for why people can’t achieve the happiness they desire.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the documentary “Happy” for this week because it was such an enjoyable and entertaining experience! Happiness is such a major topic in our society and in the popular American culture that everybody wants the secret to happiness and to live a happy fulfilling life. It was no surprise to me when I saw that the people being interviewed in the documentary answered that happiness is one of their top goals in life. Just like many others caught up in the fast-paced, intense consumerism culture in the U.S., I once thought that great materialistic wealth was the only key to happiness, that I needed to have a lot of money to be happy, that I needed to continuously purchase and keep up with the latest products and technology in order to be happy. It was safe to say that I was in this kind of trap set up by the wealthy manufacturing which propelled me along with many others like me to continuously purchase new products, wrongly assuming that we can reach the gate of happiness this way. However, after watching this documentary and throughout the progression of this course, I realized that material wealth alone is not enough to provide us happiness and on the contrary, an excessive amount of material wealth might even bring depression and other mental illnesses to us and make us even less happy prior to owning such wealth. This is not to say there is completely no value in money or wealth because there is, and we need a certain amount of wealth to satisfy and secure our basic daily needs of which happiness is based upon. Only when we do not have to worry about our basic needs such as food and shelter can we have the time and efforts to think about achieving higher levels of meaning and happiness in life. Material wealth is beneficial to our lives but only to a certain extent and with a certain amount that if we exceed those limits then material wealth might resemble more of a mental burden rather than carriers of happiness to us. 
   <br><br>


I agree with the documentary’s point about the elements of true happiness and that our extracurricular hobbies and close connections to our community, family, friends and giving back to our community have a significant role in determining our happiness level. I cannot bear to imagine my life without singing or music because I am very passionate about music and singing and they are outlets for me to reduce stress in life. I could not imagine my life without my loving family and friends either because they are such important people and mean so much to me in my life that I would remain in eternal misery if I have to live an isolated life away from them. I have also participated in numerous volunteer projects so I am a pretty active volunteer, and it is true when they say helping others makes you feel good because I really felt that whenever I was volunteering because I knew I was making an impact and a positive change in someone’s life, and this makes my life more meaningful at the same time as well. 

   <br><br>

In conclusion, “Happy” is a really wonderfully-made documentary as it exposes the true nature and constituents of happiness in our lives as it relates to our close relationship and connections to our loved ones, giving back to our community, and practicing our hobbies towards which we are really passionate about instead of buying endless pieces of new items of clothing and advanced technological products. If I were to rate this film I would give it 10 out of 10 because I really enjoyed watching it and I learned a lot of important messages and lessons regarding happiness from this documentary. I would also definitely recommend this documentary to others because it is really worth the watch and is extremely helpful in answering the century-long question on how to be happy.

I completely agree with everything you said. This is actually my third time watching this film, but it continues to be so incredibly relevant. There is clearly something wrong when our quality of life has increased, yet our happiness has decreased. As you mentioned, a certain amount of money is necessary but beyond that point, there's no real advantage to it. Sure a surplus of money can provide you with the opportunity to buy more things, but as the movie rightly noted, the excess of this junk won't really accomplish anything. The media constantly shoves down our throats that more is better, but all we really need is the bare minimum. Happiness comes from a feeling of satisfaction whether that be fulfilling our intrinsic goals or building strong relationships, money and "stuff" have nothing to do with that. 
   <br><br>
I love how the movie explores different cultures with different values because it really comes down to a culture issue. We are so unhappy with our lives because our culture is based on the "American Dream" that revolves around wealth. However, on the tiny island in Japan where the oldest people live, they find worth in their lives by being close to nature and having a strong sense of community. Throughout the US, especially LA, it feels like the only person you can rely on is yourself. There is no connection to the people and everyone just seems so unapproachable. The same can be said with our evergrowing dependence on technology, we are so attached to our phones that we limit the amount of time we spend actually socializing with others in the real world. 
   <br><br>
I also really enjoyed watching the snippet about community housing, just the idea of everyone working together and really feeling like a family intrigues me. In a previous comment I had mentioned that I would actually want to live in one but with my own nuclear family, like my children playing with my nephews and nieces or my sister being a few steps away, sounds like a dream.  Simply, building connections with others whether that be by helping them in a meaningful way or building a relationship is where we can find true happiness. And although this movie isn't an "environmental" one per se, I think it carries the same core values of working together in a community to help each other. Even the steps to becoming happier also happen to be the same steps one can take to help save the world. It's just a great film that I never tire of watching.


<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading your comment :) I'm completely with you on the whole experience of watching this week's film! Everyone has the life goal of being happy, that's why many people do the things they do because they feel like it will make them happy, perhaps for the moment or later in life. I love how this film was realistic in the way it broke down happiness, especially the elements you mention! Thanks to this course I look at things that make me happy differently now; now I don't put too much of what I believe would make me happy on material things. I used to think like you, that purchasing the latest new thing in our culture would make me happy. I thought owning things would make the feeling of when I bought them (happiness) last but it didn't take too long before I found myself looking online to see what else I could find to regain the same satisfaction of feeling great. There is so much truth in finding happiness in our extracurricular hobbies and our close connections (community, family, friends and giving back). I especially want to focus on giving back. Like you said, it does feel good when you give back! Both to your family and your community! Seeing others be uplifted by your doing and having those you care about be with you creates a real feeling of happiness, not reliant on money or material things. Money never needs to be involved to live happily. I do understand in this world we still do need it to survive but we definitely do not need it in huge amounts. This film can really change your perspective on what can make you happy and I absolutely love the answers it gives.

I really enjoyed watching the film happy. Even though it was not an environmental film i thought the message that they are trying to send applies to concepts we have talked about in class. For example, the film talks about how our economy has grown and people now have more money and more stuff. Yet studies show that we have not gotten any happier. This goes back to what Ken was talking about with minimalism and how we have cultivated so much stuff. Also , the film talked about how Denmark was voted one of the happiest countries in the world. The film explains that Denmark has more people living in cohousing than anywhere else. One of the mothers living in the co housing explained that because she was living there she had more free time, was more relaxed, and was happier because she had a large support system where everyone in the complex shared responsibility. She also noted that having all these people around her felt like one large family. Cohousing is a great way to reduce your overall emissions and as the film has pointed out, is actually a really rewarding practice. I think overall this film was really enjoyable to watch and the lessons it was teaching corrisponde with overarching themes we have been discussing in this class. The film constantly referenced the importance of human connection and having love for others. I think this is important when discussing the climate crisis. For us to make the radical change that needs to be made to save the planet we need to think about others and not ourselves. In addition, finding inner happiness and finding happiness within friendship and a sense of community will be more beneficial for us and then and the planet then trying to find happiness in materialistic items. One person's trash here in America produces more co2 emissions than the average person in Bangladesh and that's not fair or sustainable. To restate what Ken had said we are destroying our planet in the pursuit of happiness and the ironic part is we aren't any happier. 
   <br><br>
I agree with Ken. I think we are destroying our planet and it's unfair to all the other people that have half the amount of emissions as we do in the United States. I also agree with the film that we need to find happiness through deeper connections. I don't think that changing our cultural habits are going to me that our lives have become less exciting. If anything I believe that if we could all come together to support the climate crisis we could find happiness in doing something that is bigger than ourselves.

After watching the film “Happy”, I feel happy, too. It broadens my view about happiness and introduces me to different kinds of happiness, like playing, having new experiences, making friends, staying with family, doing things that are meaningful, and appreciating what we have. By choosing what we love to do in life, we could be happy easily. In the video, Ken discussed whether we are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness. Indeed, even if we own bigger houses and cars, take higher wages, and enjoy more advanced facilities nowadays, it does not mean we are happier than other people who do not own these things. In the film, many people are happy about their lives because they choose things that they love to do. This film gives me insights on what to do in my future. By following my heart, I believe I can live a life that I want.

I too actually felt happy after watching this film. I agree with Ken in his statement that we are killing the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness because for some reason we still think it will work. We don't understand that in simplicity comes clarity and peace and opportunity for lasting happiness. By ridding ourselves of all the materialistic and unnecessary aspects of our lives, we are no longer bound to those things, we are more free and more in control than we would have hitherto experienced. Simplification frees our minds from many of the daily stressors and depressors that come from materialistic living. It allows us to experience peace and contentment on new scales. Its definitely not an easy task to relinquish these things from our lives but I feel like the rewards far outweigh the costs. Even for those who don't believe in climate change or don't want to change for it, simplifying life is for the personal benefit of the individual and we should all try it regardless of our differing beliefs.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with the comment above. I also thought this film, “Happy,” also broadened my view of what happiness truly is and what it means to be happy. Both the film and Ken’s video lecture emphasized the misguided conception many people have today of believing that if you have the bigger house, nice car, or luxury items we will then be happy. This causes us to destroy the planet in place for us trying to achieve happiness. Achieving happiness does not require wealth, happiness is what you make of it. Happiness is when people genuinely love their lives and what they are doing because it makes them feel good and one truly loves themselves for doing that thing or just simple gratefulness for shelter, health or family.
<br><hr>
I felt the same way after watching the “Happy” documentary. Especially as young people, we tend to get caught up with image and status and start to think that that is our only source of happiness. But as mentioned in the film, it works like a treadmill, as once you have something, you adjust to it and start to want more. If this is true, then what is the point of constantly chasing material goods, as it's proven that none of them actually make a difference in your happiness. It's not surprising to me that the happiest countries in the world have less than half of our carbon footprint. Our constant desire to have more drives us to buy more things and think that we need them, when in reality, as proven by these countries, you really don’t need any of it to live a good life. My mom is from the Netherlands and has always raised me with these ideas. It doesn’t matter what you have, it matters what you do. She always strives to make connections with people and do things that make others happy. I have always admired this my whole life but I never thought it was possible for me to do the same. But now I realize its possible for anybody to do this. I found the stories shown in the film of people who quit their high paying jobs to devote themselves to something much higher very interesting. I especially liked the man who quit his job and began working in the home for dying people. He found such happiness from doing something for others, and not thinking about himself at all. Most people admire this but would never actually do it themselves. I think the key is for everyone to start doing the things that actually make them happy, not the things that they are told will make them happy. It was really sad to see the family of the man that died in Japan. He literally worked himself to death. It's not impossible to work less and make the same amount of money, as Ken mentioned it is done in Sweden. If we were to work less and focus less on material goods and money, we could probably reduce our carbon footprint a lot more than we think, and become happier in the process.

The documentary “Happy” showed the different views on happiness in different cultures around the world. Although I already was aware of some of the basic science and philosophy of happiness, I really enjoyed learning more through this film. The documentary talked about what Ken discussed in this video - that while it may seem extrinsic goals bring happiness (money, image, status), it is the intrinsic goals which bring a much greater sense of happiness (self growth, relationships, community). The “American Dream”, in its more modern sense, is about acquiring wealth, buying a nice home, owning a nice car. In this country we are taught that expensive material items equate to being successful. But, as I think we all find out in some way or another, material goods don’t bring us much satisfaction, and if they do, it’s just temporary, until we find we desire the next best thing (hedonic adaptation, as the film calls it). I believe many of the personal and collective actions we can take to fight against climate change, such as shopping locally, growing our own food, walking or biking instead of driving, etc., definitely will lead to increased happiness as many of these practices build a sense of community and personal purpose. Transitioning to a sustainable, healthy, and fossil-fuel free world absolutely does not mean living “drab” lives - I think it could lead to the exact opposite - much happier lives.

I completely agree with you. I think the modern version of the American Dream (that consumption=happiness and over-consumption=extreme happiness) is completely false and is selling a lie to people that will only lead to sadness and environmental destruction. I'm really glad that the film informed viewers about this truth. I also noticed a lot of themes from the class presented in the film as ways that people find happiness. Take biking, for example. Biking is an eco-friendly mode of transportation and is, I think, Ken's favorite way of transportation. In addition to being one efficient (especially in big cities with traffic congestion problems) mode of transportation that emits a very small amount of GHG, it is also a great way to pursue happiness for many people. It is a form of physical exercise and one that people will engage in multiple times a day if they use it as their primary mode of transportation. The film mentioned that physical exercise is a great way to train your brain to release more dopamine and to prevent your brain from losing as much dopamine-releasing capabilities as would have otherwise happened. For avid bikers who are passionate about riding, biking also gives them an opportunity to get into the flow state several times a day. The film didn't intend to do so, but it was very lovely to see that many of the practices that make people happy are also things we can do to become more environmentally friendly.

After watching this documentary, I have a deeper understanding of happiness. I mentioned before that people's excessive pursuit of material needs or money will really bring happiness to people. Now the documentary gives us the answer. The video says that only 10% of people's happiness depends on the external environment, which includes money, residence, power and so on. From this data, we can know that the pursuit of material is not what makes people feel happy. Because when people pursue money, they will begin to yearn for more money and then buy more goods. So money can't satisfy us, let alone bring us happiness. What really brings me happiness is to find the motivation of my own life and pay more attention to the people around me. It is impossible to get real happiness just to destroy other things in order to satisfy oneself. Only by caring for others can we experience the joy of life. All of this can be linked to the climate crisis. Just like some people give up their own interests in order to protect the environment, but they may be more loved by others. Some people have been destroying the environment for their own benefit, which has brought a serious impact on other people's lives. Although he has obtained money, he is the poorest in other aspects.

I have now seen the documentary “Happy” probably four or five different times, each time bringing me a new outlook on the way I approach my life.  This time, watching it under the lense of the climate crisis, I gained several new insights.  To me, nature seems like a very obvious source of happiness.  The amount of people who annually seek trips to national parks or invest in long-term housing near the ocean or work to provide spaces to intentionally soak up the wonders of the uninhabited parts of the planet made this belief seem completely rational.  That’s why, for the most part, my reaction to the climate crisis has been one of astonishment due to people’s desire to continue exploiting the natural resources for wealth or power.  I grew up hiking, camping, and backpacking and have always looked to nature to realign my vision for life and fulfill me with a sense of peace.  I think that the natural earth needs to remain untouched by humans in order for it to continue teaching us the importance of life.  Because of this, I firmly believe that we are destroying the planet in a misguided plight for happiness, and this documentary proves it.  It shows how people who have their basic needs met are happier than the wealthiest because they are focused on community, nature, and love.  The people who are the most successful are the ones who know how to live free of societal pressures, and ultimately the climate crisis is the earth’s reaction to people’s misguided attempts to find happiness.

I love this comment! I have personally gained a new perspective on nature and how amazing it is. I simply cannot understand how people would be okay destroying it and all its beauty. This movie definitely gave me a new outlook as well, one that makes me sad about the place we're in with the climate, but more motivated than ever to push for positive change. What people don't realize is how much nature does for us, not just in terms of providing us with resources, but in providing joy and peace and calm and so many positive emotions. Being in nature can completely change your mood for the better, and we're going to miss it more than we know when it's gone. 

<br><br>
What you said at the end about the climate crisis being a reaction to peoples' misguided attempts to find happiness honestly blew my mind a little bit, because I had never thought about it that way, but I completely agree. Our society today is over saturated with all things materialistic, and it's made us lose sight of a lot. One thing being how we're treating our amazing planet, which we are lucky to live on, with all the wonders it provides. It's sad, because we've had so many advancements, but they're dragging us away from our roots, when there should really be a balance between the two. Why can't we advance in some ways while still staying grounded? It really shouldn't be all or nothing. The earth does so much for us, the least we can do is try to protect it.
<br><hr>
I feel the same way. It is not the first time I watched this movie either, but after watching it again I gained a new outlook that made me more, well, happy. I love hiking and camping as well, and I am afraid that I won't be able to do that my whole life as the world keeps degenerating because of people's inability to just consume less. I love your idea about just returning to nature, I think it has a very calming effect. I agree with you that we are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness, and I pray we can find our direction again. Beyond basic needs, loving friends and family, what more can a person ask for.

Do we need the misguided happiness that’s currently damaging the planet is an immense way?? No! We really need to implement laws such as countries like Norway. It’s absurd that we keep damaging earth in order to keep ourselves happy in a various of catastrophic ways such as buying a new car or buying a new house or even the surplus of food which many people who live comfortable like the middle to upper classes. The carbon footprint being smaller in happier places makes so much sense. Those countries are a lot more minimalist than us maybe not not by choice but they still are happy with what they have. Now the US which is a lot more wealthier everyone seems to be so sad and depressed which is always shown in American social media and the things is most of the people in the US relate to all the sad postings. We need minimalist action done and it starts with us the teenagers.

I think Happy was one of my favorite films that we watched in this class. It was so amazing to see so many people living such fruitful lives, without any emphasis on money being a source of happiness. It felt as though they were gathering wealth in the form of human connection. I was extremely humbled watching people who have so little material wealth be beyond content with what they had. I was especially interested in the segment of the film regarding Bhutan, because I have family friends who are directly from there. The father of the family was born and raised there and now leads tours through the country. I recall hearing about Bhutan from a very young age and learning of how immensely happy everyone is there. I think there are a few key reasons why this is the case, beyond what the film addressed. Firstly, there is an extremely rich culture that has been preserved over many years. The preservation of culture is greatly credited to what I think is the next reason for their happiness: the restriction of tourists. Tourists are allowed in Bhutan, but they have to get a visa, travel with a trip guide, and pay $200 per day that they are there. Bhutanese tourism is also an extremely new concept as outsiders were not allowed in until the 70s. Finally, as mentioned briefly in the film, the landscape of the country is of high concern in Bhutanese culture as 60% of Bhutan is required to be forest. One thing the film did not mention is that Bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world! In the scheme of the film Happy, having such beautiful and natural surroundings contributes greatly to overall happiness, but in the scheme of our class, Bhutan is currently the only country which is not negatively contributing to the climate crisis.

Human beings and nature must live in harmony. Man's conquest of nature is a wrong concept. Nature cannot be created and created. Human beings can understand nature, make good use of the laws of nature, and use natural resources. Human lofty ambitions are not in opposition to nature. The story of Yugong Yishan is a tribute to people's indomitable spirit, which does not mean that this is wise behavior. When we turn fertile land into the Gobi Desert, this may not be wise. When we destroy the environment and then rebuild it, it is more costly and it is foolish. When mankind invented a weapon that could destroy the earth, this was not the gospel of mankind, but the calamity of mankind. When human beings remain mysterious about nature, we worship nature; when human technology despise nature, it is human calamity; we should become friends with nature. Waste of natural resources is shameful. Although natural resources are inexhaustible, it is a shameful act of wasting resources because it deprives people of living in harmony with nature and deprives others of their right to enjoy such resources. Nature belongs to everyone and belongs to humans. Nature belongs to all human beings, belongs to you, we, and not to any individual or organization

I completely agree! This was definitely my favorite movie. I remember halfway through watching the movie, I texted my mom urging her to watch it. We live in such a fast paced world that we very often forget what really matters. As you said, it was so wonderful to witness so many people living fruitful lives, without once referencing money as a source of happiness or success. Living in the United States, it’s often hard to step back and not get caught up in what everyone is striving for, and what many adults tell you, directly or indirectly, from such a young age, that success is measured through material and monetary wealth. As Ken mentioned in his video, any annual sum above $75,000 no longer has an effect on people’s happiness. In fact, the United States is ranked 19th among the happiest countries, which for being the world’s richest country, is pretty far down the list. As we saw in the movie, in Japan, which has some of the gnarliest working conditions in terms of pressure and hours, people are among the least happy in the world, because all people think about is working success, rather than family. It broke my heart when the man interviewed said he was going to spend his birthday with his coworkers rather than his wife, because he believed that was more important, and his family would always be there tomorrow. That’s such a horrible and unhealthy way to live. In contrast, as you discussed in your comment, Bhutanese people have incredible values that are not based on wealth, but rather culture, family and nature, and as a result, live in harmony with their surroundings, which contributes so heavily to overall happiness.

This movie is exactly what I needed to watch at this point in my life. Being in college and so often thinking about how all of this is going to help us in the future, having this was a beautifully needed breath of fresh air. It helped me take a reality check, and realize one bad grade, one missed assignment, truly isn’t the end of the world. What really matters is how I feel overall. Making sure what I’m doing is contributing to my overall happiness is so much more important than a gpa. I very often struggle with the idea of needing to take classes in order to get a degree, a job and being “successful” versus taking classes that interest me and make me happy. “Happy” reminded me that self fulfillment is always the number one priority, along with our happiness. I truly believe this is a movie everyone should watch, thank you for making it a part of this course.

The film "Happy" allowed me to reflect on the differences in lifestyles and measures of happiness around the world. It was eye opening to see how those who in our eyes may not have very much, are actually very happy people and their happiness may surpass those who have more. It is interesting to me how Americans often believe this is the best country in the world and everyone who is here is lucky. We thrive off trying to live the "American Dream" but fail to see that many people are unhappy with their lives because of the constant need to want more. However, in the film we see how other countries live purposeful and happy lives, and are content with what they have. This certainly made me reflect upon my life, since I am a senior, I am currently looking for jobs after I graduate. I know that working in education would give me a purpose in life and make me feel more fulfilled but the reality is that those jobs are not paid as well. I can possibly be making more by working for a large company in something that is not nearly as meaningful to me. The film made me realize that I have to be aware of how much I truly need to cover all my basic necessities and live comfortably versus how much I would "want" which is influenced by the world around me. I want to start my life post college feeling feeling happier not because of what I have or earn but because my life has a larger purpose.

Finally there’s a film that makes me feel hopeful and positive! One concept that leaves me with a strong impression is “happy ppl do encounter adversity, but they just respond in a positive way and in a short time.” TRUE. No one never have downs in their life, no matter how busy and fulfilled your life is. I enjoyed watching Roy Blanchard, the old man living on an island surrounded by wildlife and nature,  laughing with his big family. I also felt happy for the woman in Denmark who co-house with 20 families and share everything beautiful together. And I also hope that when I get old, I could have a positive attitude as the elder living fulfilled life in Okinawa village. And among all, I wish I could always have the courage of the great woman Melissa Moody, who traumatized after the car accident, to face the extreme darkside of life. Remember, you must believe in ppl’s resilience. You are not as weak as you think yourself to be. You can finally get over all the bad things, just like Melissa finally started a new life as a practitioner and met her soulmate now. 
<br><br>
Regarding the purpose of watching this documentary, I first got confused, cuz this film has no direct relation to climate crisis. But gradually I got it. Ken just wanted to let us know that happiness should come from your inner feeling and spiritual goal, rather than chasing for money, fame or whatever extrinsic. This includes your change to an environmentally friendly lifestyle and the abandonment of American Dream values or consumerism. Unless you accept your shift from the bottom of your heart, all the exterior efforts you make will be useless.

Holly I agree with your thoughts on the film. Generally the films we see in this class are very dreary and pessimistic, or even if they aren't they lead us to sometimes pessimistic conclusions. I absolutely agree with what you're saying, perceived struggle is universal. From the 1% down to the poorest people on earth, our brains are hard wired in a way that makes us feel either happy when we have no reason to be, or down we have no real reason to be. I found the surfer guy in the beginning to be hilarious. Especially when he mentioned that he isn't exactly living the life of a PhD-- especially cause here, so many PhD students go surfing. I couldn't believe that the guy was over the age of 40, really shows you how living a happier life can be better for you I guess. Watching this film made me think of my relatives in India. Even when they are going through hard times like when there is a flood or something of the sort, they always manage to stay resilient and keep their head up. I really strive to emulate that tenacity, and their ability to find solace in even the small things. I too was confused as to why we watched the film. Until watching Ken's video and reading your comment, I didn't really get why we were watching this film. I think in some ways this film promotes an anti consumerist lifestyle in its core message. True change comes from within.

The documentary Happy was overall a very hard hitting piece for me to get through, because of how heartfelt many of the moments in it were. However, the one that overall hit me the hardest was the moment where the father in Japan had passed away in an accident due to fatigue, and the mother was shown afterwards singing with all of the other women. This was so potent for me because it reminded me of what happened with my own father, who passed away due to working himself too hard. There seems to be an obsession with work culture here in America, where lack of sleep in favor of working more is glorified by the people. I feel like this romanticization of working harder and harder is not good for anyone, because everyone has their limits. Instead of creating a healthy balance between work and leisure, the narrative told to all of us every generation is to work harder in order to achieve what we want. But, as seen with the Japanese work culture, working harder takes away from what truly matters: spending time with our loved ones. While America’s work culture is nowhere near as demanding as Japan, we face similar pressures from our peers to work as hard as we possibly can in order to get ahead. If we spend all of our time working and no time at all doing the things that we love, then what is the point of working so hard?

I find it intriguing how a person living in slums, with only rice and salt to eat, is as happy as the average American. It’s ironic how the American Dream revolves around possession and consumption, yet it’s evident that happiness doesn’t lie within possessions when you have people who don’t have even 10% of the items you possess or near a lifestyle as the average American, yet they are at peace with themselves. It shows the differentiating mindset of what we as people believe will bring us happiness. It also emphasizes the fact that we are just prioritizing the wrong things in life, and this pursuit of false happiness not only slowly consumes us, but is slowly destroying the Earth as well. 
<br><br>

The path that we follow on our “pursuit of happiness” is completely misguided. We live for possession and we are engulfed with this compulsory consumption that leads us straight into a ditch, that will eventually consume us whole. The average american constitutes happiness with this idea that buying expensive jewelry, or the latest designer clothes will make us feel whole and happy, when in reality we are brainwashed to think so. It’s ironic how The United States has become more advanced since the 50s with a roaring and successful economy, yet the “Percent of People who are happy” has gone down in this inversely proportional trend. It comes to show that technological advancement, or bigger houses, or faster cars won’t make us happy. The truth behind happiness lies within gratitude or self contentedness. “We are told by society that to be a competent person, or be a good person is to make a lot of money”(24:20). 
<br><br>

Yes, we are destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness, because as the selfish beings we are, we consume and partake in the creation of all these greenhouse gases and pollution. But, we can’t necessarily completely blame the consumer when society itself has imposed these false idealized views of happiness and dictated how we perceive them and eventually utilize this notion in order to control us to endlessly consume, when we are just trying to conform and get a slight taste of what society deems to be “successful”. These corporations have taken control of the lives of the average American, eventually coming to the conclusion that through the control of our beings, they financially benefit heavily from our gullibility, but in the end our planet pays the price, and we are still left with that empty void in our heart and minds. The increase of consumption means an increase in pollution due to the environmental sacrifice it takes to really produce the exorbitant amounts that we consume including clothes in Fast Fashion, Mining for precious metals, production of petroleum for our fancy cars, and much more. We are all playing a part in the destruction of the planet, and in order for us to truly be happy and save the planet, we must break the mold and be grateful for all that we have. We need to follow in the footsteps of Denmark and their “co-housing” communities, because not only will it decrease our increasing numbers of pollution, but bring us together as one and give us this sense of inner peace and wholesomeness.

The film “Happy” was really enlightening to watch as it showed values that many do not take much into consideration in today’s world. The American Dream has come to be the opposing goals of happiness. It is an external goal, as mentioned in the film, that value things such as money, image, and status and goes all against your intrinsic goals that value personal growth, relationships, and a desire to help. This movie captured how important and essential intrinsic goals play a role in your life and your happiness. I thought it was really interesting when they mentioned that the more exercise, the more flow, and recovery from bad impacts is important to pursuing happiness. Our whole lives we are told otherwise. We are told that pursuing happiness is getting a good job with great pay so that we can buy and have what we want. I loved seeing how families, communities and tribes are held so tightly together and how happy they are because of it. Knowing that there are economies, such as Denmark, who have high levels of happiness makes me hopeful that a global shift from external to intrinsic goals is possible.
 <br><br>
As someone who has begun to be more proactive throughout the day by going to the gym, studying during the day to get enough hours of sleep, and choosing healthier diets I believe that this theory of what it takes to be happy is completely accurate. If more people decided to follow a similar routine where they can have more balance in their work life and self-care, their dopamine levels would be high as well. If we were to implement this more in our lives today, we would definitely be much happier than what we are today––especially in Japan. Afterall, laughter is contagious and who wouldn’t want to partake in such happiness?

When I was growing up, I don’t think I was told that my happiness in my future would depend on my job and how much money I had, etc, or if I was, I didn’t take it too seriously. What I find interesting about this is that having a good job, or a job I like, has always een one of my goals (and still is) but it’s not part of my goal to be happy. When I think about being a happy adult, I think about living close to my family, having weekly dinners with my siblings and parents, having a dog who I train, going on walks and hikes and cooking fun meals, and waking up on saturday mornings with my partner and simply being at peace. The problem is though, with the way our society is designed, if you don’t make a boat load of money, then those goals can seem pretty far-fetched. This documentary ironically made me sad, because I could see the lives that other people were living -- taking care of their family and community, being connected to the land and earth -- and it seems so far away from what our American way of life is. I wish it wasn’t
 <br><br>

When I am struggling with being happy, I remind myself of the things that lift my spirits -- mainly being outside, and exercising. The way my life is now, I don’t have a whole lot of time for that, and when I do have time for it, I spend that time feeling guilty that I’m taking a leisurely stroll rather than doing homework or studying. In Ken’s video on this film, he mentioned how in Sweden most people have 30 hour work weeks. Those extra ten hours could mean the world for me. That’s two hours every day that could be for a bike ride or a picnic or a painting. If I could design the work week, I would fit 30 hours into four days. There have been some studies about how having three days for the weekend makes people more productive. It’s sad that some systems are designed so that we literally work ourselves to death.

This documentary Happy talks about how can happily make us achieve other goals and the importance of happiness. In the film, the professor states that the most popular class at Harvard University is the happiness class, a class teaches people how to be and state happy. When people are happy, they are easier to achieve a different goal. Research also states that happiness makes people more easily success. I don't agree with what the prompt stated that we indeed destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness. It is because I don't think happiness has to be related to physical things. For example, if someone is nice to me, that will make me feel happy. But in this situation, no physical things were involved, then how can that hurt our environment. I want to point out that happiness does not have to be related to true things, it can be only a mental thing.

This documentary made me sadder than I thought it would. I think it is true that there is no pleasure without pain because if we were always happy it would just be a normal feeling, instead of a high. This must be why there were so many scenes that showed people struggling or talking about terrible things they have experienced, but so is life. It makes me sad that other people feel so much pain and hurt, but I am realizing that sorrow is an often felt and universal emotion. Being a highly sensitive person and aware of the importance of empathy, I feel deeply for others that are hurt or feel any sort of pain, emotional, physical, psychological, etc. “Happy” was a great reminder that the conventional idea of what will bring us happiness usually doesn’t bring people what they seek, such as money and material possessions. It seems very common for someone to answer what they want or seek in life as happiness. What changed in my perspective after watching this film is that I would rather seek peace in life than happiness. If I am content and at peace with myself and my life (including all things in the world that reach me and affect me), then I will be OK. 

 <br><br>

In terms of relating this film to the class, several people from different countries mentioned that they believed their government should be responsible for their happiness, or Gross Domestic Happiness. This can be done in a number of ways, depending on the country’s status in terms of different social aspects, such as health care, the education system, etc. Working towards a more reliable earth system would relieve a lot of unnecessary anxieties rooted in people that understand how dire this issue is. I think taking action against climate change would seriously improve overall happiness in people across the globe.

I really enjoyed the film "Happy" and actually found it very informative. I found it interesting that the film talked about the relation between monetary gain and happiness and that after a certain point, money doesn’t make you any more or less happy. I always thought this was the case but it's interesting to know this is something that is actually observable. There is a disconnect between having money and being happy and I feel as if a majority of people in the developed world don’t understand this fully and think they can fix their unhappiness with more money but this is not always the case. There are just some problems that can't be fixed with money. I find it interesting that the more developed a country gets, the more depressed it gets and while I think an increase in consumption that goes along with development just correlates with  the increase in depression and doesn't cause it, the fact it doesn't decrease it is interesting.

I do agree with the points that you have made in your comment. Tangible items can only go so far to satisfy us as humans. In a sense, finding satisfaction in many material things has some addictive qualities to it. It is funny how we want some things and once we get them, we continue to reach for a state of happiness we can never seemingly get to with possessing more stuff. At a time in my life, I felt myself slowly falling into this trap, until one day, I realized how messy my room was with things I did not need. I also began to realize how privileged I was and I felt guilty knowing that these items I found unnecessary could mean everything to someone else. So yes, not all problems can be solved with money; if anything, money can cause more of them.

I really enjoyed watching the film “Happy” and gained more insights altering watching Ken’s video. The film taught me that we can make a choice when things happen in life and these intentional activities constitute 40% of our happiness degree. I love this film because it looks through various countries in the world, presenting the differences and similarities of the lifestyles of happy people around the world. Although this is not an environmental documentary, I found that many happy people around the world find their approaches to enjoy happiness which are environmentally-friendly. In contrast to people living with consumerism who believe that materials are necessary for happiness, happy people follow their intrinsic goals such as personal growth, relationship, and desire to help. For example, people living in Louisiana love rowing on the lake and watching birds and other animals. Denmark have numerous co-housing communities, where many families live together, eat dinner together, and share certain chores. People who live in the island of Okinawa enjoy longevity and happiness, growing vegetables and provide gifts for friends and neighbors. In Namibia, people have complete interdependence with each other and with the natural environment. These happy people work and live in community and co-exist with nature, paying little attention to wealth or social status. They watch sunset and sunrise as well as wild animals, plant food themselves, and live in co-housing communities. Comparing with the American dreams about more, bigger, and better stuffs, these lifestyles can actually bring people close together in a sustainable way that’s also beneficial for our planet. 
 <br><br>

    As Ken said, we are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness, a way that is opposite to the film “Happy”. The misguided pursuit of happiness includes consumerism, materialism, and endless thirst of power and wealth. Ken provides more examples of the happiest countries in the world such as Sweden, in which average people produce 1/4 of greenhouse gas emissions of average Americans. This country is a good example of embracing collective bargaining and strong unions and citizens’ well-being is taken care of by government. Therefore, we need a deep cultural change in accordance to the idea in the film and the sustainable and satisfying lifestyles.

Yes, we are actively contributing to the destruction of our planet in a pursuit to find happiness in material items, and in turn, we support big corporations that capitalize off of our unhappiness. We put all this faith in materials such as fashion and technology that we really think will make us happy, but once we get it, we just want more and more. 
   <br><br>
 One of the statistics I found extremely interesting from the film is that 50% of the differences in our happiness levels is determined by our genes. Even when something very good or bad happens to us, we tend to revert to our genetic range. I also found it shocking that only 10% of our happiness comes from our circumstances, such as job and income. It is very true that the statement that money does not buy happiness is both false and true at the same time. I am sure if my family had more money, we would have less to worry about when it came to paying off the overbearing bills and we would not have to worry about putting food on the table and making sure we have running electricity. However, but just because someone has money doesn’t mean they’re going to be happy. Seeing how the workweek is for Democratic-Socialist countries such as Sweden, it shows the all the alternatives we could implement here in the U.S. while also emitting way less carbon gases along with the population being much happier. The movie showed how cruel we can be to each other. We are so concerned with competing with each other, we forget that if we would all just work together, everyone, including the planet, wins. We need to collectively work together to protect our planet from further destruction and make all of us happy.

After watching the documentary “Happy” I had a sense of clearness on certain things I should focus on in order to live a fulfilling life. The result of watching the documentary was a sense of gratitude and understanding. I now know some things I can do to not only be happier myself but also to help others be happier and positively help our planet. An interesting fact that stood out to me was the percentages of where our happiness comes from. It allowed me to have a better understanding of what I can and cannot control for my happiness. The percentages were as followed: 50% is genetics (which I never knew before and it demonstrates that all people won’t have the same kind of happy as others but its about being content with your own); 10% is how comfortable we are/circumstances (money can’t buy happiness but it is necessary in order to be comfortable); and 40% intentional activity (actions you choose to do can make a worlds difference on how you view and experience your own happiness). I really enjoyed that they included each of these percentages and how they all relate to one another. 
 <br><br>
 I grew up in a small town of the gateway to a national park so I had it pretty nice and was taught to be very grateful everyday with my mother implementing 3 things we were grateful for before we could eat our dinner every night. My mother was one to always give and to raise us in the same way. As I was watching the documentary of the scenes where helping others and surrounding yourself around people who were also happy helping others reminded me of how happy I was to do the same when my mother would initiate certain programs within our community to give to and help others. I believe that my mom recognized that we were rather stable and when you are there’s no reason not to help others and I think she found a result in great happiness when she gave and was grateful; these are the aspects that she wanted to pass down to her children with initiating projects like: “Pennies for Pakistan”; "Tsunami Relief"; "Public Lands Day"; “Hugs for Haiti”; dinner for those in need; blanket making for hospital patients (Project Linus); and simply buying extra food when we’d see a homeless person on the side of the road. Growing up with this support and guidance from my mother has made me a happier person and realized the same as the people in the documentary. I believe if we demonstrate and teach about the happiness that ignites within a person when they give and appreciate, it can create a happy world to be open to changes to help our environment to end the climate crisis.

Hey, I really like your comment and I agree with you. While watching this documentary I realized how much control I actually have over my happiness. We are so worried about our future and being successful that we forget about our mental health. It was very eye-opening for me to see the source of happiness and sense of love within other cultures. I also thought the percentages were interesting because I never thought of the science behind happiness and where it came from. This class has made me question my lifestyle and my cultural practices, but after watching this movie I feel more motivated to help others, do meaningful things, and leave aside the material stuff.

I agree it was very interesting to see  a larger percent of happiness comes from intentional activity rather than circumstances. I thought that circumstances would have a lot higher of a percent on the influence of happiness, but was surprised to hear it only accounts for 10 percent. I agree that being raised with a sense of helping others and lifting others up instead of just competition which is encouraged a lot in today's society can have a great impact of a persons grasp of happiness. My parents always taught me to be humble, and to help another person if I am able to remind me how my grandparents came from a very humble background. I love hearing about my parents' childhood despite it being difficult they were happy and I think nowadays kids are being more influenced on what happiness should look like by social media. I think it is important to preserve the things from older generations that brought happiness such as going out to the park and enjoying nature rather than staying indoors all the time playing video games. If we can teach children young how happiness can come from appreciating the little things in life like a nice day outside rather than materialistic needs that is emphasizes in this capitalistic society, we still have a chance in changing  as a society for the better. If we are able to change society to a more healthy outlook on what happiness entails we can move towards a more environment friendly way of living.

First, I want to say that I truly appreciate you sharing a piece of your past and how it impacted you. You mentioning how your mom had you give 3 things you are grateful for before eating dinner every night and how you believe something like that had a positive affect on your happiness, encourages me to do something similar the day that I have kids. In less than a month I’ll be an aunt for the first time, I want only the best for my soon to be born niece and want her to be happy. If I can do something as simple as encouraging her to think of what she is grateful for, I will gladly do so. Especially because when I am not living in college, I will be living with my brother and his daughter, meaning I’ll have available access to her during all my breaks. Thanks again for the wonderful idea.
<br><hr>
I found this comment very sweet and inspiring. I feel like if more people shared the same sentiments as your family about giving and being selfless then we would be way happier as a society! Helping others whether done with little effort or large efforts are so personally rewarding when you get to see how happy it makes them, and I wish our society viewed that as valuable instead of hoarding wealth for one’s own preservation. I’d love to make an impact on my hometown for the benefit of others as your mother has for your town, as I have a very tightly knit community at home.

I really enjoyed watching the film "Happy" because it shed light for me on what true happiness meant. I completely agree with the points in the film that physical activity is one of the main drivers of happiness. I grew up around sports -- specifically swimming and soccer -- and played on club teams from elementary to high school. I can say with one-hundred precent confidence that I only have fond memories with my teammates and coaches, and to this day I rely on these sports every time I feel sad, angry, or bored. Even if there were times during the swim meets and soccer games where I felt like I did not perform well, these frustrations drove me to be better and ultimately gave me that feeling of accomplishment you get when you overcome a barrier. These were my "intrinsic goals" growing up that allowed me to constantly push and compete, all the while leaving me to feel happy and satisfied regardless of the results of the competition. On the other hand, things that I thought added extra happiness to my life -- new clothes, money, etc. -- only brought short, temporary rushes of excitement. The hedonic treadmill, or hedonic adaptation, was a concept that I had never heard of before the film but believe that many people, including myself, experience. I think the only way to not be stuck in a constant cycle of temporary, false - happiness is to not be so caught up in chasing "external goals" like fame, wealth and status. After watching the film, I remembered just how appreciative I am to be able to take a class like this where we learn how to identify and find true happiness. There are many people in America's capitalist society that have long lost this insight on true happiness because society tells them that fame, power and money will give it to them.

In high school I too played sports, nearly year round and I remember going to practices as almost an escape from everything. When you are on the field and in the zone, everything disappears and you can just focus on what you enjoy. Of course there are frustrating moments, but at the end of the day, going out and running around with people that you know and enjoy spending time with is priceless. I don't think I was any happier when I was able to make it to the finals in  my high school lacrosse playoffs. The culmination of all the work and effort not just me but all my teammates put into that was far better then getting a new computer or new clothes. I think that is what the film was trying to convey. Its not what we have or who we are, but what we do with our lives and if we enjoy doing that. Personally, I would prefer a life where I can do what I love instead of a life a stress to get some material thing.

Today, I was lucky enough to watch Happy for the second time. The first time I saw the film I was a junior in AP Environmental Science. Man, did it feel like a different movie today. 
 <br><br>

While most depressing topics are about the state of the Earth, Ken’s comment that Americans are becoming less and less happy was most terrifying. I hate the thought that I am happier than my grandchildren ever will be. Something has got to change. Will a happier Earth lead to happier Americans? I think its hard to tell considering that most things that make us happy are environmentally poor decisions. Let us think of a cheeseburger. A cheeseburger brings so much happiness to so many people yet it is one of the worst things you can eat. Similarly a private jet is one of the largest tokens of wealth yet are one of the worst ways to travel. Big houses, nice cars, steak dinners, fancy clothes. Will people only be happy as long as the Earth is sad? 

 <br><br>

The United States is ranked 19th in happiness levels. What is up with that? Many of us have incredible lifestyles with so much to do at the tips of our fingertips. Yes, we may have a crazy president, and political debates left and right but it is hard for me to believe that 18 countries have it easier than us. 
 <br><br>

This goes back to idea that we all need to start talking about our happiness more. One thing that America does not do well is confront our mental illnesses. We need to raise more conversations about mental health. I think that is where other countries are beating us.

I completely agree with you that mental health is a big issue here in the United States, and that it may be one of the reasons why we are ranked 19th globally on the happiness scale. I did some research online and found that the suicide rates in the U.S. has increased 24.2 percent from 2000 to 2014, and this isn't taking into account all of the attempted suicides. In my opinion, the proliferation of highly-addictive drugs in the states, combined with the rise of social media and the cyberbullying / social isolation it brings are major contributors to mental health issues. Even though we are more developed than most other countries technologically and economically, it is apparent that Americans are struggling to find "true happiness" that the film talks about. We are stuck on the hedonic treadmill; we rely on mass consumption of material items for temporary rushes of dopamine that we mistake for happiness. As a country, we have to start building social capital -- forming deep, meaningful relationships with our local communities -- in order to stray away from this mass consumer culture we are so eager to chase because society says we need all this "stuff" to be happy. If we don't redefine what it means to live high-quality lives, people will continue to only be happy as the Earth is sad like you said.

I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary “Happy”. I never get tired of seeing how different people around the world live, what they value, and what they find joy and happiness in. The one thing that seems constant between all people and their happiness is being surrounded by friends and family, people who genuinely care about you and your well-being. I come from a large family, both sides of which are Greek. It amuses me that every time there is a get-together on an occasion like Easter or Christmas, there are so many people that my parents know (and that I probably should know), and while they may have not seen them in months or years, everyone is happy to see each other, as if no time has passed since the last time they saw one another. It is an incredible thing to see so many people interacting, sharing stories, and just enjoying the company of one another. That seems to be the case with many people in this film as well. Oftentimes I forget the importance of family and staying connected to people when I am so focused on making money and doing well in school. This film helped me remember the value in that once more. It also reaffirmed the fact that I do not need to fill my life with meaningless objects and material possessions in order to find joy or happiness. Simplifying my life only makes focusing on my impact on the environment, family, and my health even easier.

I agree you on how you viewed the movie. Happiness is the main thing that people forget when it comes to the spectrum of life. We have 1 life to live and so does earth, and this movie gave us examples on how we can live life to the fullest while still saving our planet as well. I have a very large European family as well and family holidays are always the most happy time of the year. My dad and mom taught me that family is the first priority in life. Before my Grandpa passed I'd say as long as I could remember, my dad used to call him every single day just to check in. The happiness in my grandfathers voice every single time he called was something that I will never forget. I think that getting back to the basics and removing all this unnecessary clutter and nonsense in our daily lives will improve our lives as well as the earth's.

I liked your sports team reference, because the team is only as strong as its weakest link. Every country putting aside their differences and conflicts to team up for the greater good in the battle of the earth, because all humans are on the same side; only together can we win.

Most of this course content made me apprehensive and worrisome about the future and our current state of affairs. I've felt helpless because of how little of an impact I can make directly, and I stopped attending lecture for a little while because I did not want to feel that sense of hopelessness. However, I find comfort in this video, which summarizes the individual steps one can take to help make the change the want to see in the world. Sharing this video and its content with others and living in accordance with these new 20 Commandments is the answer I've been looking for and has helped my climate depression.

Let's try to get this video trending on YouTube and go viral to spread the message ! Michael Jackson once said "I'm starting with the man in the mirror, I'm asking him to change his ways, And no message could have been clearer. If you want to make the world a better place, Take a look at yourself, and then make the change!"

I really enjoyed watching this film. I liked seeing the variety of different lifestyles of people who would consider themselves happy. They all led different lives, with different backgrounds, in different parts of the world, doing different things every day. This really shows that there is not one secret formula to happiness. One must go on their own journey of discovery to find what makes them happy, whether it is a hobby, the right people, an occupation, or certain actions. These things can all put one “in the zone” or “flow” that can trigger feelings of happiness and fulfillment.
 <br><br>
I liked the message denouncing the importance of huge amounts of money. With only a small increase in happiness after a certain income, people should not be pursuing promotions or new jobs that pay more just for the pay increase. If the work itself will not improve the sense of fulfillment, or will only bring more work and stress, there is no point in trying to earn a surplus of money. One should find a job that they enjoy and do no more work than their body and mind can healthily deal with. It was tragic to see the common nature of death by working in Japan. Clearly, doing more work does not contribute to greater feelings of success. As the mother mentioned, her husband constantly looked as if he was contemplating something else. He was exhausted and unable to fully appreciate what he had in front of him.
 <br><br>
This divergence from what many people see as happiness, relating to material success and money, would definitely contribute positively towards battling the climate crisis. With healthier communities, and people happier and less stressed, people can focus on making the world a better place.

I completely agree with you.  I really enjoyed watching this film, not just because of the cool facts about happiness that I did not know beforehand (such as the fact that our happiness level overall has not changed much in the past 50 years despite technological and economic advances), but also because of what you talked about: daily life.  This people from all around the world found something about life that many of us have left to learn - that there is more to happiness than one would think.  Like you said, it should not be about how much money someone makes in their job, it should be whether they enjoy it.  Of course that is an age-old saying that could be repeated endlessly while it goes in one ear and out the other for most people, but it is really true - money does not mean happiness.  Of course, to a certain degree it does, but once your needs are met there is no reason to want more.  It reminds me of my grandpa in Mexico.  He owns restaurants in Mexico City, which is a big feat in and of itself, as he started as a small business that turned into a semi-chain.  But, though he had wished for a fuller wallet in earlier days, his mass success has also brought him a stress that he never had before.  He now has to be wary of kidnappings and his money getting stolen, which has become a huge burden to him.  It is one of the main reasons he decided to move his family, including my dad as a teenager, to the US, despite him having to stay in Mexico to run his business.  I have seen the stress it puts on him, how it is hard to not be with your family.  As it showed in Happy, the relationships we form are extremely important in avoiding sadness - for my grandpa, it is seeing his family every so often, for me, it is going home on a weekend from college or hanging out with friends.  Sometimes I find myself wondering about what my choices for life in my future would make me happy, but this film reminded me that enjoying the moments I have now is a big part of it.

Watching “Happy” really reinforced my ideas on happiness and what makes me happy. At first, what really struck me was how there was so much community and togetherness in Denmark, especially in the co-housing units. It makes sense that a community was formed in the housing shown, but just seeing how stress was lessened and satisfaction was increased really made me compare that to America’s everyday household. America has the mindset of “what don’t I have” versus “what do I have.” Like the film said, we live in a society that encourages competition, which leads to constant unhappiness with that you have now, to always wanting things that are bigger and better (usually relating to money/materialistic goods). I feel that having this mindset is practically setting oneself up for failure in terms of long term happiness. I do understand that money may bring people happiness, but to an extent. There is a difference between needing money and wanting money. Needing money is when you do not have the basic necessities to live such as food, shelter, and clothing. Wanting money is when you have a substantial life, yet you crave more. Wanting more is what leads to unhappiness.

Not too long ago I gave an elderly man 20 cents for the bus. I noticed he was on the sidewalk counting change for a while, and I had asked if he needed any change. Something as small as giving a stranger two dimes made me feel happier and more content with myself than I was before that moment. It really is little acts of kindness that bring people together, and ultimately lead to being happier overall. Just having friendly conversations with strangers makes me happy. All in all, happiness stems from changing your mentality; we need to care about things outside of ourselves, and come to the conclusion that what we have in our lives is enough. We should be joyful ourselves and spread love.

I also found that the living communities in Denmark stuck out to me. Watching a single mother have reduced stress in everyday activities like cooking meals for her children made me happy for her content lifestyle. Additionally, all of the kids are able to grow up together and have both friends at home and at school, and they look like they wouldn’t ever trade their life for anyone else. So many people around the world are so happy with their minimal lifestyle. Yet Americans gravitate towards what is bigger because it is seen as better. 
  <br><br>

Another point that stuck out to me was having all basic needs met is all you need to have happiness. This was a really interesting point because majority of Americans don’t have this mentality. There is always a need for more; a better paying job, a better car, etc. Our consumerist society speaks in a way that it is hard to reach satisfaction. However, this has opened my eyes to my future; money and materialistic goods aren’t everything, and I would much rather live a simple lifestyle than


<br><hr>
Something I really enjoyed about your comment was how you talked about the problematic, American mindset of focusing on what we do not have rather than appreciating what we do have. I think that this mindset is especially present in families where poverty was once present because although you may now have enough to be secure that sense of anxiety is still present. It can be tough to overcome this mindset and focus on all of the amazing non-material things you have around you but it is something that we should all work on. Everyone taking this class is lucky enough to be getting a college education, even if at times it is terrifying to think about the student loans that many of us are having to take out. Taking a step back in my own life I am lucky enough to have a loving family and need to acknowledge that more because many people have difficult relationships with their families that put a strain on their lives. We all have a lot that we worry about, and I acknowledge this and understand it can be quite overwhelming, but we all have a lot to be grateful for as well, even if at times it can be tough to remember that. One particular part of the film that comes to mind as I talk about focusing on the positive rather than dwelling on adversity is the story of the woman that was in an unfortunate accident where she was run over. Despite this deeply painful and terrifying event, and the several other challenges that she was faced with after such as dealing with past trauma and a divorce, she was still able to remain shockingly positive after looking at her life through a different perspective.  

 <br><br>

Another aspect of your comment that really drew me to respond was how you included a personal story about how you were able to make such a meaningful impact on someone’s day by doing such a simple action. Not only does this demonstrate how people with so little are able to find happiness in the smallest actions, but it also shows how easy it is to help others find joy by doing something that does not even require much thought or effort on your part. Imagine if we all stopped focusing on the encouraged competition that is so rampant in America and instead worked on being more aware of the needs and feelings of those around us. If we were to spend less time competing we could build a stronger, happier community that functions more efficiently and accomplishes more good deeds. The man that you helped did not ask you for change but you were aware that he was counting. You could have easily ignored this, or not even noticed in the first place, and gone about your day but instead you took a moment of your time to help someone out. As you mentioned, this made you happier as well, so all around it was a moment that demonstrates how we can all become more satisfied with life when we are more connected with those around us. 

 <br><br>

Along the lines of the personal experience you shared I would like to share one as well. Ever since watching “Wasted! The story of food waste” I have been trying to be more thoughtful about how much food I am buying as to not produce unnecessary waste. Unfortunately a restaurant that I ate recently had quite large servings that I was aware of too late after ordering. I knew that as I would not be home for quite a few hours the food would not stay good if I was to take it to go. Rather than letting it go to waste I figured that as there is a homeless population in downtown Santa Barbara someone would benefit from having the remainder of my food, even if that was all I had to give to them. The man that I gave my food to was extremely grateful and told me that he had just prayed for food before I had stopped to give him my leftovers. Although this was not some groundbreaking action that changed his life I was still glad that he now had a meal that could get him through one night. It is so easy to help people with small actions that will cause at least small amounts of happiness, so whenever possible we should do our best to help each other out.


<br><hr>
I agree, there is a large difference in needing money and wanting money, and I think there exists a big flaw in the United States, where we have so many people who are unhappy simply because they cannot afford to live in the country they were born in. We do not have a system of wealth distribution that advocates for or benefits those with little. It is asinine that in the United States we have anyone that is homeless and cannot find housing resources. Additionally, it is absolutely insane that we do not have a basic universal healthcare system, to allow people the basic security to know they will be bodily okay, whilst living in a society. I don’t like that you giving 20 cents to a stranger made you happy, because you shouldn’t have to have that opportunity to do that in this country in the first place. It demonstrates a massive issue in regard to how we chose to take care of people and allocate our resources.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you say about the problematic nature of wanting money. It creates a bad cycle, like a dog chasing its own tail, where you can never be content with what you have when there is always the opportunity of having more. And more. And more after that. It's never ending. Clearly, it's never ending even when you're at the very top when you look at people with Jeff Bezos. Always seeking out ways to make more money, to avoid spending money, and all that. This constant craving of more does not lead to happiness. Craving cannot lead to happiness. Craving means you're deprived of something. Therefore, once satisfied with what you have, you can fill that deprivation which is often thought of as a deprivation of things or money with actual things that result in happiness, whatever that may be to you. It may be doing small acts of kindness for others, it may be doing big acts of kindness for others, it may be so much as just enjoying your favorite hobby, enjoying good company, or just enjoying something without desiring something else or something more.

Throughout this course I have been waiting to see if and when the film “Happy” would be assigned. I have seen this film at least 4 or 5 times throughout my time as a student in high school, community college, and now UCSB. The reason why I was not at all surprised is because in this class we have been talking a lot about the misguided pursuit of happiness disguised as the “American Dream” and accompanied by mass production and consumption. The core idea of true happiness has been associated with the wrong things, rather than emotional connection and gratitude it has been marketed as fancy cars, big houses, and excessive amounts of money. As society becomes more ‘advanced’ and younger generations are raised within in, there is a new level of complexity that arises. Social media can be used as an incredible tool for communication and connection. However it feeds individualism while strengthening the connection between the user and their online “relationships” and in return it can cause a disconnect from their “real” life. The ability to compare yourself through media to the “richest” and or “most attractive” people in the world can be a really negative experience. I really think it fuels this idea that if we as humans can attain “that” than we would be happier. This unrealistic and probably for the most part unattainable standard increases the desire and aids in why people lose focus on how the relationships and experiences around them are the most important. 

 <br><br>

When I think about my personal level of happiness while comparing it into the breakdown of where it comes from, I understand a lot more about myself especially right now. 40% of our happiness is based off of the extra experiences and outings we bring into our own lives, 10% is school or work and finances, and the other 50% can be genetic. Americans in general are chasing a “dream”, where the guidelines to achieve it include absurd amounts of work and the goal of money. I find it interesting when Ken talked about how after $75,000 a year as a salary, there is not a distinct difference in someones level of happiness. Even if we are making lots of money from a job we have committed our lives too, it only will make us 10% happier. I spend 90% of my time attending school, doing homework, and studying for exams because of my heavy course load. I never prioritize activities that I would enjoy because I am often times tired and I feel that I am too stressed out to enjoy anything. That alone is removing almost half of where I am receiving happiness should be coming from. We get so caught up in the idea that we have to work so hard and keep progressing and never take a break until we retire, that we miss out on so much in life. The film this time around shifted my perspective once again, and this time it is to slow down and shift more energy into my self outside of school, and put more time into the people around me.

In contrast to you, this was my first time ever watching this film, however I feel very similar to you. I think that this film really connects to what we have been talking to throughout the course and really compliments the materials well. Throughout the course we have been talking a lot about consumerism, and how much Americans consume things that are believed to make us happy. This film does a great job at showing how all those material goods that us Americans attribute happiness to are in fact not necessary. I am almost certain that if any American would see the way that people in India live, like those that are portrayed in the film, would say that there is no way that they are happy. Most Americans, including me, would consider that they are living in extreme poverty and there is really no way that they could be happy. However, we see in the film that although they do not have the luxuries that most of us Americans would take for granted they are as happy as we are and in some cases they are even happier than us.
 <br><br>
Personally, I believe that living a simple life doing something that you love with the people that you love is the only way that someone can achieve true happiness. I really was reminded of this when the film showed the part from the island in Japan. I really was able to see what I believe into play. People that live in that island live very simply, spend a lot of time with their loved ones, and spend time doing things that they love. I truly believe that large amounts of money and material goods don't bring true happiness and can only make you happy until a certain point.
<br><hr>
I completely agree. I have found myself reflecting on all of this a lot more and this film put things into perspective even more for me. The American ideal is warped as when children are asked what they want to be when they grow up their answer is usually rich, not happy. A lot of people right now in college are majoring in something for the prospects of being wealthy, not happy. People stay in majors that they hate because it has real job prospects, not because it interests them. So those people are spending their whole time in college and after college unhappy trying to chase after money. School and financial stability is important no doubt. The world doesn't stop and being stable is important and practical. But it shouldn't have to drain you to reach that. It reminded me of the film earlier, Minimalism, where the Wall Street man had spent his whole life working on Wall Street to make the 6 figure salaries only to find that he wasn't happy. That is my greatest fear; stopping in life and realizing that I wasted in an attempt to climb a corporate ladder or become rich while not being happy and neglecting the things in life that make me happy like relationships and being outdoors etc. I personally have been investing more time into the relationships in my life and spending time outdoors and enjoying what is around me and the life I'm living. I am taking classes that interest me and majoring in something that I am passionate about with the end goal of being happy and finding my work and prideful, not because of the money. I have seen it in people around me who have worked their whole lives under the facade of the American dream to become wealthy and have more stuff and be able to flaunt it yet 1) that goal is highly unrealistic and 2) comes with the cost of happiness as you neglect true connections with people and the world. 
 <br><br>
America needs to model itself after the Scandinavian countries because people obviously need their basic needs met. America's obsession with money has to do with the fact that so many people are deeply without it. So many people in America cannot afford healthcare, education, food and basic need that should be human rights because our government doesn't work like that. When those are covered like in the Nordic countries. people are able to put more effort into meaningful work and have productive communities that can put their energy into projects and better things since they don't have to worry about their basic needs. They can focus on having good relationships with friends and family other than the working parents in America who can barely see their kids or keep up with the community relations. When they have their basic needs met people can do great things, and become a more educated and fruitful society. America's state of living and standards for happiness are so deeply flawed and warped because we have grown up to believe that money = happiness since for a lot of people in America, money = basic needs met. Americans don't know how to enjoy things really because we spend our lives working.

When watching "Happy" I was almost confused as to why it was included in an environmental class because at first glance it doesn't appear to be related to the climate crisis at all. But after watching it I realized that there is actually a very strong correlation between the idea of "happiness" and the effects we see on our environment. For example, in today's modern age it is a common trend to see that many people relate material/tangible objects to their overall happiness. With the popularity of consumer culture and the need to own expensive, large, and luxurious things, it is a common trend for people to think their belongings will bring them happiness. And these ideas lead to the manufacturing of more things and the manufacturing of more things just leads to more waste and eventually leads to long term damages to our environment. I think it was very important for this video to be included in this class because we should all learn to understand that we do not get happiness through how much we own or how much value our belonging equate to, it is deeper than just material possessions.

The film "Happy" in a way addresses people which I feel can help gain an understanding of the environment. You see across many countries the way of living and how that, in turn, affects their happiness. Considering the man who first showed up in the film who lives impoverished and works as a rickshaw driver really can put things in perspective for people and allow them to realign their values which is that not much is needed to feel happy, now I'm saying everyone would be happy living in poverty or to try doing so, but that happiness doesn't form as a result of wealth but from having a strong sense of family or community, but in addition doing things that make you happy (safe things). Consumer culture is terrible as it results in becoming competitive as you want to be the best in order to be admired or to gain approval. People spend so much time to be accepted as no one wants to be a loner or not included as isolation leads to depression. I essentially agree with all your points, but I feel like depending where you live consumer culture varies and it's due to how the media portrays things in advertisements or the celebrity influence with living a "millionaire" lifestyle, but I also feel like social media plays a role as there are people in the US who feel truly happy and I noticed how it would be those who are at a distance from this fast-paced lifestyle of constantly needing more.

I had a really similar reaction when watching this film at first, though I was pretty okay with it because it looked like a nice documentary.  It is really interesting that in America at least, a lot of our fulfillment seems to be based on how much stuff we have, the size of the stuff we have and how many people we can tell we got new stuff. This whole thing made me think back to American history class in high school, learning about the rise of consumerism in the 50s when the American middle class started to boom and grow.  I think it really altered the course of American history, to where we cant even imagine a world without rampant consumerism, for most of us it's all we or our parents have ever known.  I find that so many of my favorite things are my staple things, my trusty pair of white sneakers, the blanket I've had since childhood, a set of metal pens I've been using and scratching up since 3rd grade.  Things that are good tend to last a while.  Whether they are well made or we just take better care of them for sentimental value, things should last.  There is no reason for our obsession with acquiring and discarding goods at such a lightning speed.  It seems to go against our evolution, acquiring slightly worthless things constantly just to know that we will probably part with them in a short while.  It would just be so amazing if we could acquire the balance between consumers, culture and economy that would allow for production companies to survive while also allowing individuals to have minimal high quality and long term usage goods.  I guess this would come with remodelling our economy, downsizing all of our massive industry to more local needs and demands, and deciding wheter or not having all of our things is not having a healthy Earth to keep them on.

This film stood out to me on multiple aspects, I often caught myself smiling while just watching it. A connection of happiness that I felt as if the film makers kept coming back to was community and kindness. I felt as if those tow aspects went hand in hand for creating happiness. I love the part of the movie that captured the elderly population living in Okinawa, Japan. Everyone seemed so happy and pure, they did not need much but community. The young helped the old, and the old helped the young. They were constantly surrounded by their friends and people that loved them.
 <br><br>
I felt as if I was able to relate to this video on a variety of levels. Personally I would characterize myself as a happy person. I am very happy in the life that I have and the friends and family that I am surrounded by. I would attribute y happiness to my family, friends and community and the way that I have been raised; surrounded by love. However, there are times when I find myself in periods where I feel sad and down. When this happens the thing that constantly makes me feel better is stepping outside myself. To think about all the people that I love and have in my life, and putting myself out there to make someone feel better, taking the time to do a small act of kindness makes me feel exponentially happier, and it is contagious. If you smile at someone, they will likely feel happier and pass that on to someone else. For example, just the other day I was going to mail a letter and the person in line ahead of me also needed to send a letter. The post office only took cash and he did not have any on him, but I heard this and offered to pay. This small task on helping someone out to make their life a little bit easier made me feel good the rest of the day, while simultaneously sparking an interest inside myself that I really wanted to continue to do acts that helped other people out. I feel as if we could get more people to start spreading kindness then we would have a happier country. 
 <br><br>
Another thing that I really liked in the video was the communal housing. The women who choose to live their opened-up stating that she was not going to be in a good place if she lived in an apartment by herself. Instead she gained a family and community to moving into the community home. I thought this was a really neat idea. It is hard for people who are sad or depressed to put themselves out their own little bubble, they often just tend to seclude themselves. I think that living in a community space would be very beneficial for people struggling, or who are lonely, or really anyone. 
 <br><br>
I really liked learning about happiness in this film. Learning that only about 10% of your happiness actually comes from your actions was very interesting. I think this film is really important for people to watch and learn where happiness comes from and what one can do to make themselves happier.

I also found myself smiling throughout the second half of the film with specifically the film’s focus on Okinawa Village as you had mentioned. Although this is drastically different than the environment-focused films that we previously watched, I am grateful that Ken included this film to highlight a significant aspect of culture all Americans must realize in which happiness shouldn’t be solely obtained through material wealth and finances even though people have different value sets. By recognizing this, we can find the faults in our misguided associations of happiness and the consequences that are produced by such industries, affecting our environment and even international workforces as we watched with the garment manufacturers in Bangladesh. What I really loved about the portion that centered around the Okinawa Village was the communal aspect of the elders who were loving towards each other and even to the children as if it was a full circle with the old generation loving on the newest/young generation. It was, however, disheartening to see the “karoshi” with the toxic lifestyle that Japan experienced with the lack of work-life balance as people were not only mentally but visibly suffering through physical tiredness and even death as a result of overworking culture.
 <br><br>

I believe that with the changes we can make for a more environmentally-friendly culture will also result in happiness for all if we can learn to find happiness in more meaningful relations and associations. Although aspects of our lifestyle will definitely be affected or at least reduced, it doesn’t mean that our lives are changed for the worse. It requires a change of perspective to acknowledge the greater need for the planet to be set on a better path if we can learn to be selfless rather than selfish. If done correctly, the result of a smaller climate footprint for every individual can result in a better system for all Americans in which hopefully every individually is financially sustained and supported by the system rather than oppressed.

Overall, the documentary “Happy” by Roko Belic argues that everyone in the world could obtain their happiness in a variety of ways. The director travels around the world and approach different people from different countries in the form of interviews about their levels of happiness, from which he basically states that when food and accommodation space are sufficient for people, the economic factors like income levels have very little effects on people’s happiness level, with the example of Iceland and Puerto Rico. Personally, the main takeaway from this documentary is that factors like money, social status, and work only account for a percentage of 10% of our happiness, and what really dominate are our genetic set points, which were determined by our genes and personality traits, and intentional activities on a daily basis. Also, one thing in the documentary that uplifts me the most is that the key to happiness is to fight through our toughest moments, not indulge ourselves in overjoyed experiences, and bounce back to the track where we gained most of our happiness since these moments won’t last too long. Moreover, one terminology that refreshes my mind is the hedonic treadmill, in which people become wealthier and then continually adapt to their new circumstances, resulting in an endless desire for more things. This is demonstrated by the statistic that Americans doubled their income in the past 50 years but their happiness level almost remain the same. I think this serves as an alarm bell to all of us.

Hi, I also think the main message of this film is that the external factors such as money and social status do not correlate to our happiness. Once the minimal necessities are provided like food and water, economic factors do not really relate to one's overall satisfaction in life. I enjoyed how the filmmaker uses a balanced scientific research and true stories to to analyze the components of happiness. It overflows the documentary with positive energy and joy shared by human experiences. People should pursue happiness by what they love to do rather than following sensual details.


<br><hr>
I agree with what you said. Although I already watched “Happy” a while back, I do appreciate watching the refresher and the reminder of what’s important. I did not realize that desire to help, relationships and personal growth were considered intrinsic goals, but I definitely appreciate knowing this now. I will be even more intentional about this because of this! I also appreciated the restatement that “People who experience flow on a regular basis are happier than people who don’t.” I hope to increase my frequency of flow states as a result. I do feel like fighting that hedonic adaptation tendency is pretty rough. Gratitude and mindfulness helps to avoid it, but are sometimes not at the forefront of my brain. At the end of the day, I believe that compassion is one of the biggest solutions to our world’s issues today. On another note, I feel like the fact that the US is considered one of the wealthiest nations and yet no were near one of the happiest should say a lot about we should probably seriously consider what other countries are doing differently.

“Happy” is the perfect film to show that we do not actually NEED any of the material items and luxuries that people in the US value so greatly. The majority of our happiness is pre-determined by our genes; outside factors likely account for only 10% of our happiness. The evidence? People are no happier now than they were 50 years ago, despite the overall economic and material growth.
  <br><br>

Happiness is directly related to the quality of life; not in the sense that a “good life” (whatever that may imply) leads to happiness, but that happiness leads to high-quality relationships, work achievements, and an overall feeling of well-being. I feel like it is so obvious that it would be nicer to work less, spend less, and have free time to do the things that we enjoy instead of working a lot, spending a lot of money, and never being satisfied with the present. 
  <br><br>

Our society is so preoccupied with success and wealth and owning luxurious material goods that we seldom work toward the things we actually want; the things that will actually make us happy. Some people want to be doctors purely for the money, rather than because they are actually interested in doing it. This simply sets you up for a tireless work life, where you may likely never be happy. Instead, we should do what we want to do; what we are passionate about, what we are interested in, what makes us HAPPY. As Ronaldo Fadul said, “try to work so you’ll be able to live your life in tranquility”. If you are working in a subject that you genuinely enjoy, then it will never actually feel like work. Working hard will be less tiresome and more rewarding if you are doing it because you actually want to. 
  <br><br>

Sometimes I feel like I am constantly putting off the things I want to do because I don’t have time for them. Then, the days just go whizzing by, and I run out of chances to do those things. I fear that my entire life will end up like this, and that I will look back and regret not doing the things I liked when I had the chance to. I feel like my situation is analogous to climate crisis solution implementation; I don’t want to ever look back and regret not doing more for the planet while I could. I feel like so many people think that climate change is not a crisis, or not even an issue; but, how will they feel when their children or grandchildren ask them “how could you do this, how could you let this happen?” as the world crumbles? We have to do whatever we can while we still have the chance, and we can do this while being happy. 
  <br><br>

Apparently, there are two intrinsic goals which are the true sources of everlasting happiness; personal growth and community feeling. Thinking about the climate crisis in relation to true happiness reminds me that every single thing that we do to mitigate this crisis is also contributing to our happiness, since every solution demonstrates either personal growth or community contribution (and often both). I don’t think that implementing climate change solutions is negative in any sense; what’s negative is the way that society has been conditioned to live, and conditioned to react to change.

I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiments. I've eve had a huge reconsideration of what going to school for career paths really means for me. Happiness absolutely does not stem from material goods, though material goods can certainly add short-term pleasure to your life; happiness comes from what you do, who you meet and interact with, and the experiences you gain. 
  <br><br>

This is not to say that you cannot find happiness from things that bring you immense wealth and success, like becoming a doctor, actor, singer, lawyer, things of that nature; it's more to say that you should not choose to pursue a lifestyle simply because it will make you a lot of money. You should be able to choose to do things in your life that make you genuinely feel excited and giddy, not things that you have to drag yourself to get through just because it gives you a nice back account balance. The problem is that society tells you you can't really enjoy life in the way you actually want to without having to slave away at jobs. You want to travel? You have to finance your transport, lodging, activities, and more. You want a home? Have to be able to cover mortgage, down payments, bills, debts. Want food? Costs more money. New car? Have to be able to pay for the car, insurance, gas, new tires, and more. It goes on and on and on. 
  <br><br>

Money becomes such a huge focus and prioritized goal for people that it detracts them from anything that actually matters in life, especially important real-world issues like climate change. For now, people aren't concerned because in America, the effects aren't really showing as much as they are in places like the South Pacific or Bangladesh. It's an issue that can be ignored and left for other people to fix. People may assume that if politicians or governments around the world pitch in to invest towards better climate solutions, the problem will go away on its own. But money can't fix everything- not the effects of climate change, not how well a government is run, not how society views various issue, and certainly not your, or anyone else's, happiness. 
  <br><br>

That's why I like the stories presented throughout the film. They show that happiness can be correlated to helping issues like climate change, because the choices that are made in these situations release genuine "feel-good" chemicals into your brain. You know that what you're doing is good and beneficial for not only you, but the entire Earth.

The film "Happy" did well in preaching the true meaning of life. Often times, we focus too much on the bad things of life instead of realizing how lucky we are. Take, for example, the Brazilian surfer Ronaldo, he lives such a peaceful and simplistic lifestyle. Ronaldo believes living a happy life depends on what you do with a passion. this differs from the typical American lifestyle where we want to do too many things and own too many things. This film made me realize how people with great adversities manage to live their lives without baggage. If instead of loving one another, we are hateful for one another; we lose ourselves. By this I mean, the pursuit of happiness should be embedded in the fundamental law of life which is to love everyone and everything. 
  <br><br>


I think if the human race is in general happier,  this can have a huge positive impact on the environment. If people are willing to work with each other to solve the climate crisis problems.

I definitely agree that the film focused on living life with emphasis on the intangible things, like relationships. It was really inspiring to see people that maybe didn't have as much as you living their absolute best lives. It puts thins into perspective for sure.

After watching this week’s film, “Happy” I thought long and hard about the privileges I have. I often correlate privilege with white privilege or wealth, but I have come to realize I have my fair share. Since I was a child I was taught I should be grateful and take advantage of the fact that I was born in the country of opportunities. And it's true. Without federal grants or my teachers’ and parents undying support I would not be in a world class institution pursuing a degree in the prestigious UCSB Sociology department. My parents always talk about their poverty stricken childhoods, my mom would tell me how her mother would go hungry in order for her six children to eat. My father would tell me how hard it was to sleep on the floor because you had to keep a lookout for snakes and spiders. But they also told me that it taught them to appreciate nature and what little they had. Whenever a pig or cow was killed, they would use every single part of the animal for food or medicine. Here in America, an entire hamburger could be thrown away without a second thought. Americans have come a long way to achieve this way of living but it is undeniably built on centuries of war, colonialism, slavery, institutionalized racism, unchecked capitalism and death of workers. It was not too long ago that the United States abolished slavery or banned child labor, why not improve the rights of factory workers or farm workers as well? Instead create programs that are sustainable and pay their worker’s fair wages. The American lifestyle and “pursuit of happiness” needs some drastic change.

Reading your comment reminds me of the saying "you don't know what you have until it's gone". I think it's the perfect phrase to describe the situation of America right now. Most Americans don't blink an eye when ordering plates and plates of food at an restaurant or throwing away an item that is still perfectly useable. In this context, like you said, is acting the way we do without caring about the consequences, simply because we don't need to deal with it.So, what if the world really becomes uninhabitable? Americans will be forced to change their way of living completely, whereas people in other countries may have already been practicing a frugal and sustainable lifestyle. 
  <br><br>
I also hope that America will soon realize that changes still need to be done and that it is far from being a model and "leader" country in the world. In fact, the high living standards and lavish lifestyles that Americans are so proud of is exactly the reason why America should be ashamed. I have faith that rights will extend to factory workers, farm workers, and then eventually animals. However, the problem is: when?

Although I watched this documentary in Ken's class last quarter, I yet again this film to be both entertaining and informative. I actually watched this with my roommate the first time, and both of us found it to be interesting and had mostly emotional reactions to the content. A major part of our destruction of the environment is due to our culture of consumerism, which bleeds into nearly every aspect of our lives. As a society, we are constantly told to desire the latest technology, fashion, or other luxurious items that have little impact on our actual well-being. These items, however, are detrimental to our environment, as the costs of producing them far outweighs the benefits. The idea that our material possessions will translate into our personal happiness is deeply imbedded in the media we consume on a nearly daily basis, as advertising tells us we need to purchase things in order to be truly satisfied with ourselves. This documentary showed that what we own does not have to dictate how we live, and there are other values that determine what makes us happy besides our wealth or material possessions. I was surprised to see how small the relationship between income and happiness is, despite often hearing the phrase, “money doesn’t buy happiness.” One of the statistics that stood out to me that Ken mentioned was that, after reaching a salary of $75k, money has little impact on one's personal happiness. I feel like many people have the desire to be rich and successful, but it’s difficult to finally feel satisfied with the amount of money you have made and feel as though you have reached fulfillment. Because of this, people continue to spend more, and work more in order to finance such desires. Although this idea is rather depressing, I enjoyed seeing the ways in which different communities have found happiness by focusing on friendships and family values. It was inspiring to see people turn their lives around and choose to have an optimistic outlook on life instead of giving up due to the obstacles thrown at them. 
  <br><br>
As for Ken's points made in the lecture, I found it interesting that he brought up the governmental impact on its citizens' happiness, as it is evident that countries with more climate conscious legislature also happen to be in the top rankings of the happiest countries in the world. The United States
  <br><br>
despite our consumerist lifestyle, is ranked 19th on this list, while also contributing massive amounts of emissions to our environment, resulting in the slow destruction of our planet. Hearing this information, I wonder why so many people are opposed to the type of legislature in Scandinavian countries, such as Sweden. Clearly, our lifestyles and massive carbon footprints are not contributing to our happiness, despite the pursuit of happiness being a key part of our country's essential rights. Honestly, one of the major points that I learned from this lecture is that I should move to Sweden and work a 30 hour week and get paid vacations AND a year of maternity leave. At this point, I see no downsides to living in Sweden. However, I am hoping that the United States takes a few pointers from their government and realizes that our current methods are putting more than just our planet at stake, but our mental health as well.

It is great that you highlighted that our habits of consumption are instilled in us through media because this indicates that our perception of the road to happiness is fed to us and we can unlearn it. This threshold of past $75k where money has little positive impact on happiness suggests a shift we should make to only consuming what we need. Thoreau addresses this in Walden too- that there is a point when one starts consuming in excess and this only leads to excess work, neglect of  emotional health and relationships, and additional worries and constraints. It is totally about values. Socially and culturally in the U.S. our value is financial success, communicated by material wealth. We do not generally value happiness or emotional and mental health. I would argue our country's economic system distracts us from the pursuit of happiness as capitalism thrives when we constantly consume. It is in marketing's best interest to sell us this ultimate goal of material wealth. Our happiness and health do not make corporations money within our current system, so we are not marketed the truths about happiness. While it could be great to live in Sweden, we can shift our values here and make this a better, happier country.

As a college student, I often find myself losing my own happiness and caught in other people's
definition of what my happiness should be. The pursuit of happiness is a lifelong journey, but it
seems like “happiness” is often not found in my everyday life. Perhaps it’s the constant pile of
work, or the glorification of college student’s poor mental health. I find myself sacrificing my
health to uphold responsibilities and standards, and doing that has only created unhealthy habits.
I can feel my body and mind shutting down and I know that I’m too young for this to be
happening. As a result, I am trying to push more healthy boundaries and discover my own
happiness. I want to do things with more meaning in my life— to create meaningful relationships
with those around me and discover what I truly care about in the world. I’m learning to
appreciate what I have in life and doing more healthy things for myself in the long run. Being in
college also seems like a race— everyone is trying to climb the ladder and will stop at no
expense. In the process, I’ve lost a sense of compassion over the years and have only been
focused on myself. I now realize how unhappy that makes me. I spend more time comparing
myself to other individuals, rather than acknowledging the work I’ve put in already and how
everyone takes their own path. I want to be a better person and be kinder to those around me.
I’ve lost my sense of compassion and I am taking steps to regain that back in my life.

I connect with this comment immensely because as college students, we can easily lose sight of our true means to happiness and contentment throughout all degrees of our life. Watching the film and putting our lives into perspective with the people in the movie I feel allows for a greater understanding of the true definition of happiness. Understanding what makes these people happy with the simplicity of surfing, working, family, etc. can make us materialistic people get a better feel for happiness. The testimonies these people have such as the beautiful woman who got run over by a truck and now is married to a man named Happy, make you think certainly ask yourself, is this situation really as bad as I think? Watching this film along with recognizing who we are as human beings individually and the values we hold, allow me to understand the true meaning to happiness.


<br><hr>
 I totally agree. Especially at a school like UCSB, I often compare my happiness to that one skinny girl on social media who wore a cute outfit to the dayger on Saturday. We’ve all been there. I also feel ashamed of myself when I fail to study for a quiz or put off doing homework even when it's for some self-love time, hanging out in my bed. I’ve felt that deep hole that you’ve been in and you’re not alone. For times like this, I really resonated with the message from the movie that “one key to happiness is overcoming adversity”. From multiple stories, i heard the message of accepting challenges and the damages they put on us, and allowing ourselves to move on. I think this aspect of the movie is really important to remember. We don't have to be “happy” all the time. Life is really hard sometimes! But if we allow ourselves to feel hardships and learn how to overcome them quicker, we can live happier lives.
  <br><br>


Additionally, I feel like at the start of college, I was looking for the same thing: to find new passions and create new relationships. However, I also got caught up in society, questioning what my life was “supposed” to look like and comparing myself to others. It's SO easy to feel this way. Whenever I feel this, I walk and go look at the ocean. Gotta love UCSB…

I thought the film "Happy" was the most interesting film we have had to watch for this class. I even enjoyed the part of the man talking about what he was surrounded by in Louisiana because you could just see the joy in the man's face when describing his surroundings. (He also kind of reminded me of the firefly from The Princess and the Frog and that character was very humble and appreciative as well.) One of the things I found interesting about this film is that it mentioned that 50% of happiness had to do with genetics. It was also interesting to see the different types of things that can make us happy and how they vary. I think the film did a great job because it included different types of experiences and gave examples from all around the world.

I completely agree with your comment.  The film "Happy" was completely uplifting.  I really enjoyed the film after having learned about many of the negative effects that come along with the climate crisis.  I enjoyed the different cultural lifestyles portrayed throughout the film.  It was especially nice to watch the part of the film where it was explained how in Bhutan, there purpose is to increase their happiness and not their economy.  I found this truly admirable because most countries like to expand in power and wealth and don't really care about the individual happiness of people.  The film was enlightening to watch and I truly enjoyed that it was not centered on one particular lifestyle, but it documented many.

The documentary “Happy,” was a very interesting and a enjoyable film to watch. This film was basically a how-to guideline for happiness. However it focuses on what happiness truly is, how one can achieve it, and how it relates to our lives. The film illustrated both those who have achieved happiness, as well as those, have not which then made me take a step back and reevaluate my own life and the choices I have taken or plan to take and made sure they were responsible and fulfilling ones. This film also made me realize how grateful I am for the resources I have as well as my physical health. When I came across the part in the film of the Indian family who slept in practically an open hut and worked and provided for themselves and their family, along with the father who owned his own rickshaw shed felt as though he was the happiest man on the earth, I realized that I need to acknowledge more often what I have and find happiness every day for the fact that I can have the opportunity to get an education, be nourished, and sheltered. The father said he was happy that he had somewhere to stay and food in his stomach as well as each other. 
  <br><br>

Being happy does not have to be defined by how wealthy one is or the fancy clothes or the newest devices one has. What makes happiness is finding that wealth and richness in the materials you do have whether they are extravagant or not and find the desire and gratefulness in everything you own along with the thankfulness and love for family.

I really enjoyed your comment, Analyse. I also was touched by the scenes in this film which showed the less fortunate family in India, and it really made me put my own life into perspective. I feel as though almost everyone in America and developed countries take for granted the amazing opportunities that we have and the amazing lives we are able to live and the safe and for the most part just structure our governments give us. I personally struggle with paying for tuition, however when I consider the fact that I have a roof over my head, food to eat, and a loving family, I realize that I should not be so upset about financial issues. Some people have it so much worse. This film reminded me what it takes to be happy, and it is not material goods.

Such an uplifting movie. In the attempt to uncover the meaning of happiness, this movie really made reevaluate all the things I have in my life. This plays in perfectly with what we have been talking about in class since the call for individual action by changing one's lifestyle is only feasible through a genuine interest in a sustainable lifestyle. Looking for what makes you happy and the understanding of why that is is really important. I enjoyed watching Roko Belic travel to so many different countries and recording all the unique cultures. Culture is impacts our way of life dramatically. By contrasting our own culture here in America to those in other countries, we can learn of the factors that play into forming a happy life. With the oversaturated perception of more money directly influencing happiness, this film debunks this idea and examines the simplicity of living happy sans all the over consumption and expensive luxury. I do believe that we are profoundly impacting our planet in a misguided pursuit for happiness. But I am conflicted because the nature of my desires and aversions are out of my control. There are influences that dictate what we perceive to be happiness and those influences are here long before we are born.

I really agree with you. This film means a lot for us. What is real happiness? A pair of fancy shoes or luxury cars? I think we can have certain enjoyment about these things, but waste is unnecessary. As you mentioned above, a sustainable lifestyle is better for us because it is indeed good for our environment. In previous videos, we have seen many drawbacks of quick fashion. In developing countries, minimum wages and working conditions are terrible because they need to manufacture more clothes for brands. I do not want our happiness to base on other’s unhappiness. More youth including me are influenced by propagandas from social medias. If we can reduce tiny parts of our happiness, the world can be better.
  <br><br>
Education is really important. After receiving education about reducing waste, more young generations will reject the quick fashion.

When watching the documentary “Happy,” I was shocked to see just how happy people were in other countries. What was very shocking was that Manoj Singh, the rickshaw driver in India, is just as happy as the average American because he is dealing with rude customers and running under the burning sun to make a living while the average American has it much easier. This movie showed many different lives all over the world and how they find their happiness. It makes sense that one we meet our basic needs we will reach our peak happiness especially after going through eight weeks in this class. In earlier weeks, we learned that most material objects only give us joy for a short while until we move onto the next thing. I found it enlightening to see people so happy while living in communal spaces or by running a traveler boat across the bayou. Additionally, when hearing Ken list of the top seven happiest places in the world, it was shocking to hear that they were of the coldest countries. Does being so cold create a better space to be happy? Maybe. Ken continued to talk about the structures they shared and how most of these countries had systems that best represented democratic socialism. The sound of the system sounds great to me because it provides a life that meets basic needs for everyone but also allows everyone to have a say in changes to policy or laws. This type of system is literally for the people not just for the privileged people. On top of this type of system, they have great work weeks where they only have five days of work with each day only being 6 hours. Also, they receive 25 vacation days per year and parents receive 480 days of paid maternity leave split between the two parents. Just the thought of having a work schedule such as this sounds like a huge relief of stress in comparison to the schedules here in the United States. My schedule itself sounds so terrible in comparison to that of Sweden’s since I am currently taking 19 units with two jobs that are more so on-call based where some weeks I have no work and others I am going right up to 20 hours a week for work. This past weekend alone, I worked 20 hours and came home so exhausted that I went to bed at 9 pm rather than my normal midnight schedule. If the US were to even apply some of these tactics that the happiest countries use, we would be saving the planet while also making us happier people in life.

I agree. After watching the film I was definitely surprised but I was happy to see that people in other countries are happy even though they are facing harder circumstances. I think the fact that Manoj Singh is as happy as the average american shows us that we need to be happier no matter the circumstances. I love how the film takes us on a journey of each individual and explains their circumstances and shows that they are happy no matter what. This film made me happy seeing how happy other people are. I also agree with you referring back to previous lectures when he learned about material objects only give us joy until we move onto the next thing. After this film it furthers the point that we should be content and happy with our current situations in life because in reality we are very fortunate, and the fact we move from one thing to the next makes us look very spoiled and foolish.


<br><hr>
Same feeling that when I heard Manoj Singh said that he is happy even under the cruel living condition. The film even said he is happier than many Americans. This actually tells people that money, status, and images, those external elements are not the determinant of happiness. As you said, the film showed the happiness of different people in different places. But they have one thing in common: none of them is the high status or wealthy. Everyone has different ways to become happy, and those ways are simple. 

  <br><br>

Ken said that the government also acts a role of being happy. Yes, it is true, but not that much. In the movie, we can see that Japanese people work a lot. But the person they interviewed is happy. Though Americans work a lot more than Sweden people, this is not the main reason for not happy. The movie said when you have the “flow” or “in the zone”, you will be happy. So happiness is created on our own. Manoj lives a hard life, harder than most Americans, but he is happy. So too many working hours are not the main reason for not happy.

After watching the film "Happy" I was very optimistic about how I can live happier. The film introduces how modern science tries to understand happiness. When studying identical twins, scientists discovered that 50% of our fluctuations in our happiness level are due to our genes which are known as the genetic set point. With work, money, social status, and health, happiness only accounts for 10% which is really small and then the other 40% is from daily actions. One of the keys to happiness is our ability to overcome difficult moments because people overestimate the impact of happy and sad events in our lives. This happy or sad emotion they don't last long. One chemical characteristic that is needed to be able to feel pleasure or happiness are dopamines. An example of producing dopamines is through exercising. The most interesting part of the film was the state of "flow." This idea involves living in the moment and forgetting their ego. The next section of the film is about the hedonic treadmill which is the idea of wanting more to stay happy. Some other ways to be happier in life are to give yourself extrinsic goals that focus on our external being  (money, image, status) and intrinsic goals which are personal, rewarding goals (self-growth, relationships, community feeling). The happiest people are the ones surrounded by family and friends. Through social interactions and cooperation, it can activate dopamines. A practice the film influences people to do is meditation as it can promote kindness and compassion.

A few of the sections of the film that you mentioned in your comment really stood out to me, and have got me rethinking some of my life goals and ambitions a little bit.  Putting it scientifically and realizing how statistically 40% of our happiness can be attributed to our daily actions at first made me think that the number was disappointingly low.  I think that we are taught to believe that our actions and regular lives are by far the most important thing in the pursuit of happiness, we like to have this vision of control where we are the sole determinants of our life's enjoyment.  To recognize that half of our happiness is due to factors entirely outside of our control and assigned at birth can be frustrating and disappointing to people, especially Americans who's culture stresses the importance of self reliance and independent growth.  But after my initial ambivalence about the statistic I came to see it in a new light that the movie was trying to showcase.  Instead of focusing on the 50% we cannot control we really should be focusing on the 40% that we actively can.  It makes me think of the well known prayer, "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference."  Now I personally am agnostic and religion has had little to no influence on my life, but this quote still holds a great significance to me as I think it can for basically anyone.  Whenever life gets to be difficult and stressful, whenever things start to feel like they are spiraling out of my control, I like to think of this quote.  It puts into perspective my place in the world and how in so many ways I really do have little to no control over the events that occur in my life.  But this sentiment is oddly inspiring to me, it makes me reconsider my circumstances and motivates me to attempt to improve what is changeable in my existence.  By accepting what I can't change it makes what I can change and the problems that come with it seem fewer and easier.  I think a lot of what the movie was talking about relates to this.  We put so much influence on the big factors in our lives, and expect major changes to have drastic impacts on our happiness and well being.  It just isn't the case however, as the biggest factor in our controllable happiness levels really comes down to the little things we do in our average day to day lives.  Although it is not a hard fact to understand, to truly believe, accept, and integrate its message into our lives is not actually so simple.  But by trying to recognize our ability to change these small, yet consequential, ways of living we can slowly adjust ourselves to be much happier overall.

It’s true that little things can make you happy. It’s fascinating to look at happiness from a scientific point of view because for such a long period of time, we only view it as an emotion. Perhaps, sometimes when you can’t find an explanation for a sudden urge of joy, it could all be the result of your genes since it accounts for half of the determining factors of your happiness. Surprisingly, work, money, social status, and health only account for 10%, which could be one of the main reasons why people in Bangladesh could experience the same level of happiness as an average American according to the index provided. As long as daily needs are met, it would take a lot more to raise the scale. Personally, I think any emotion can last for a long period of time, but it could also last for just a quick moment. A lot of times, depression and anxiety linger around and people usually have a hard time dealing with them especially those who don’t seek out for treatment. Exercising in any shape or form is a great way to boost your mood but also strengthen your mind and body. No matter how busy I am, I always find a chunk of time to work out every day even if I have to wake up early or stay up late. It’s relaxing to me and to me being able to move your body it’s a privilege. I’ve gotten myself into a couple accidents in the past. Not being able to move my body was probably one of the worst feelings one could have. I see why retired athletes usually would go through a period of blueness since your body would have to be in its prime to compete professionally. Our society today runs on the hedonic treadmill. If you don’t have something, you would do whatever you can to get it. It’s the capitalistic mindset. If you already have it, then you would want more. The combination of extrinsic and intrinsic goals helps us reach the kind of happiness that everyone should feel on a daily basis.

The documentary "Happy" confirms my previous idea that there is a negative relationship between happiness and the amount of greenhouse gas emission. It is ridiculous that we exit tons of CO2 to pursue happiness, but in the end, we lose everything--both happiness and a great environment. So why we do this stupid thing for such a long time? The answer is that we are misguided by the consumerism. Don't be angry about those advertising and fast-fashion firms though, because none of us are Innocent in hurting the Earth. We should be clever and recognize our true needs. Unfortunately, there are still many who are completely believe in this misguide after watching so many warming videos like this. We should, and must realize the fact that the environment is destroying because of ourselves. Actions must be taken immediately since we have limit time left. Indeed, poverty can hardly create joy, nor does too much wealth. There is nothing wrong with pursuing a better life and earn a higher salary. However, endless seeking for wealth will lead to negative outcomes. Therefore, it is better to stop and ask yourselves what exactly you want and require.

Happy was such an inspirational and moving film. I immediately felt extremely moved by the many pursuits of happiness that people all around the world consistently go through in order to make the best of their lives. I found myself reflecting on my own life and what I have been doing that keeps me happy. With this thought, one that I usually don't delve upon often, I was struck with overwhelming emotions, making me realize how well off I am. The opening scene for the documentary showcased a family who was extremely happy regardless of the their living conditions. I was immediately affect by this as I, and I know a lot of people do this too, complain about any minor inconvenience that comes my way in everyday life. I began to reconsider the purpose of my goals venturing into the financial industry, whether if it's for money or genuine happiness and joy of the skills. It's crazy and maybe cheesy how this documentary affected me, but I think that because these thoughts don't come up often in every day life, they tend to spark when I watch a moving documentary that leaves me feeling vulnerable yet grateful at the same time. Happy was one of the most meaningful documentaries I've ever seen.

I really liked the film “Happy” because it shows the audience that there are other things that can make us happy besides money and materialistic goods. One part of the film that I really liked was when it depicted the lifestyles of people in many other countries in comparison to the American lifestyle which is consumed in consumer culture. Many people who are searching to achieve the “American Dream” base their goals on the idea of attaining more materialistic goods, however as Ken pointed out, the irony is that even if people have financial security and lots of material goods, we are still not necessarily happy or fulfilled. This film does a great job demonstrating that happiness can not be found in external goods, and that it comes from intrinsic values like relationships and personal growth. I also liked how the film introduced the idea of the hedonic treadmill, a theory that demonstrates that even as people make more money, they also experience a simultaneous increase in desires and expectations which does not increase happiness. This connects back to the idea of the American Dream, which is also based on materialism, yet does not bring a person happiness. This film reminded me of something that I learned about myself in high school,  making other people happy makes me happy too. The idea of being able to make someone happier brings me more joy than buying a new piece of clothing, which I think is a good in the sense that i don’t feel the need to buy material goods to feel happiness. This film made me reflect on my own life and helped me realize what really makes me happy and what I find to be happiness.

After watching the film Happy, I realized how twisted and pessimistic my view on intimate human interaction is. In the film, when the concept of co-housing was introduced, I honestly couldn't stop thinking how cult-like this whole living situation seemed. Despite witnessing how co-housing actually operates, and how genuinely happy and free the residents looked, I just couldn’t place myself in that living situation. I asked some friends what they thought of co-housing and many of them agreed with my  thoughts. I think our perception of co-housing reflects on the society we were brought up in. We are so used to keeping to ourselves and constantly maintaining this distance around others. By co-housing with others, people break this distance and essentially blur the line between what is privately owned and what is owned by all the residents. This illustrates one of the main issues addressed in this film—happiness cannot be derived from materialistic items alone. Although I don’t consider myself materialistic, I guess the root of my problem is that I am still too reliant on my possessions. The fact that possessions give me more comfort than loving and nurturing human relationships is honestly troubling. Maybe this unconventional way of living is not only what our environment needs, but also what our society needs.

The film Happy has really revealed to me how lucky we are to live in a privileged and powerful first-world country like the United States. It has also shown me that happiness is really a state of mind, and that it depends on how you look at the situation you in that determines your happiness. At the beginning of the film, they show the rickshaw driver who lives in a half a house with his large family, barely making any money, and working all the time. However, when asked if he was happy, he answered “yes”. It’s very interesting how lots of Americans aren’t happy even though they have tons more than many of these third-world countries. I think this goes to show how consumer driven we are as Americans and how much stuff we buy that doesn’t make us happy. We have been told that the more money we have, the more things we have, the happier we will be. However, there are many people around the nation who do not feel happy. Why is this? Again, we have been brought up on the idea that to be successful we have to make a six figure salary and be able to buy more and more things. 
<br><br>
I think everyone has a slightly varying definition of happiness, and some things make some people happy while other things make other people happy. The movie happily revealed that happiness is 50% inherited, 40% intentional actions, and 10% circumstances. I think this is interesting because many people believe that their happiness and lives are based off of where they are from or their economic standpoint. However this is not true. It is up to the person to be happy, not these outside factors.


<br><hr>
I completely understand your feelings. I don't view myself as stingy, greedy, or things alike, but I would feel some sort of way when that line of whats yours and whats everyone's gets blurred. It would just take a lot of adjusting to it, honestly. Am I up for it, though? I don't know about that. I still like my own space. I wouldn't mind living with friends and family, but if it's it's with randoms, I don't know about that. And yeah, we focus too much on materialistic things. This is due to our "American Dream" mindset, which is something that can be hard to change in a lot of people.

Happy really showed me that you don’t need money to be happy, it actually causes more problems. People that work all the time for money have less time with their family, just like the man in the video. You spend all your time working to get things you enjoy but by the time you actually get them you’ll be in your late fifties or sixties and have wasted most your life sitting behind a desk when you could’ve been spending that time with friends and family. I believe that time with your family has more value to me than working all the time just so I could get an item. The only thing that is sad is that in some places, many people have to work all the time to be able to support their families. I really believe happiness can not be bought and that we should really spend our time doing what we value if we’re able to. Expensive items are not worth the time that will be taken away from your family. So instead of spending money on things we don’t need, we should spend time with our family, which also just happens to be helping our planet at the same time.

In watching "Happy" a second time, I was able to take note of things that i had not paid much attention towards before. Similarly to before, I was immediately drawn in by how they described happiness in the beginning of the film. The film was comprised of various stories of happiness throughout different parts of the world. Many of the stories stood out to me from before, particularly the sections on co-housing and Japan, but I also found myself comparing the different views on happiness presented to the culturally ingrained happiness of America. As Ken remarks upon, the American pursuit of happiness has been more detrimental than helpful, especially with the capitalistic culture that subscribes happiness to materials. It's strange just how different the perspective of happiness are throughout the world. The drastic contrast between the small town in Japan to normalized Americanism seems dumb because aren't we all humans, yet why is it so hard to define our own happiness. Maybe there needs to be an immensely impact moment, such as the event Melissa Moody experienced wherein she lost herself after the accident and therefore had to find purpose in a different manner than before, in order for Americans to shift their goals of happiness. This materialistic view on happiness has been ingrained into the American culture for centuries, but I suppose that slowly, but surely things are starting to change as people begin to realize just how detrimental it is to ourselves and the planet.

The piece about co-housing stood out to me as well. It's been mentioned a couple times in the past couple of weeks and I has remained somewhat skeptical. But seeing it in this film really made it seem real and even desirable. Everyone seemed so happy and they all cared about each other. I also see your point on just how odd it is seeing the perspective of happiness and what brings it differ across the world. It was tough to watch the short interview with the business man on a busy street, where he said one of his goals was to be happy, but struggled to answer how he would achieve happiness, eventually answering, "money, a whole lot of money." It's troubling that that has become the American Dream. It's even more troubling, to me at least, that I too would struggle to answer how I would achieve happiness. I would say that I'm a happy person, but I'm not sure I live in a happy society. The graph from the beginning of the film, showing income rising but happiness remaining steady simply proves it. Bhutan, on the other hand, has decided to value happiness over money, I believe they called it "gross national happiness." I thought it was amazing to see a country value the actual well-being of the people over the value of their GDP. It was inspiring and gave me hope, especially the way they talked about it. When the film talked about Bhutan, it was so simple, it seemed so easy yet the US would never even consider such actions. I'm glad this is one of the films we ended on because it has a really good message and gave me and a lot of others hope.

The Film “Happy” was one of the most inspiring films I have watched in this class. It goes to show that money and material things are not what constitutes real happiness. Many times I find myself wanting to have a successful career just so I can afford nice things, but it’s important to take a step back and realize that this is not what will provide long-lasting happiness. It was very interesting to see how other country’s lifestyles differ from america in terms of stuff. In many other countries less is considered to be more, which is how it should be in America. Not only will having less stuff be less of a burden on our mental health, it will help us protect the climate due to less things being produced for consumption. Overall, I think it’s very important to ask yourself what will make you happy instead of what will make you the most money.

I really like your comments. People with more objective satisfaction does not mean that they have more happiness. Steve Jobs, one of the top elites said that I hope I can spend more time with my family when he left the world. He owns everything objectively, but what he regrets is he does not own happiness due to lack of time with who he cares. It’s great for people to actually choose a minimalist lifestyle.People get what they need and they easily get satisfaction.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment, I also find myself stressing over money because I want to buy nice things and have a nice house when I grow up. The film "Happy" kind of reminded me of when we learned about the fashion industry and fast fashion and how people are constantly buying the next best thing keep up with the trends and feel good when they buy something new. Recently I have come to realize that money can not buy you happiness. In America, we have always been taught that money and success will bring you a happy life. I totally agree with what you say in terms that many other countries in the world have far less than us and still live a simple happy life. Also, if you rely on money to make you happy then one day that money can be gone and you will be left with nothing.

The film “Happy” had an overall theme of stop trying to chase the perfect life, and that consumerism isn’t a fast track to happiness. I found it interesting that they showed how people from different cultures and how they practice their happiness. As in the case of the tribe in Africa, they found happiness through the community, growing and supporting one another. 
<br><br>
In the U.S if you ask most people what they would need to be happy they would answer with success, money and/or love. In my opinion, though, happiness is fulfilled when you come to terms with who you are, appreciating what you have and enjoying the little things in life.

I couldn't agree more. The film "Happy" showcased the fact that the American way of life is less structured in the sense of happiness. What I mean by this is, is that American society is promoted to always want more for an individual. The film displayed how other countries pursue happiness, and it is very different from the way Americans do so. The happier countries have more of a community and come together to support one another, which in return promotes more happiness.
<br><br>
In contrast, America has set their ways of life and so have other countries. Which is fine, but America now has this way of life that keeps us in this rut, and that is something we have to live with in this society. After watching this film, I think it helped me to find ways that promote happiness for myself.

I really enjoyed this film, but initially, I couldn’t help but wonder why Ken wanted us to watch it. At times, like when they mentioned co-housing, I thought I understood the connection, but it wasn’t until I watched the lecture that I started to realize how happiness can relate to the climate crisis. In this film, they introduce the concept of the hedonic treadmill, meaning that regardless of one’s wealth, people will always adapt to want more. I found it interesting that there was an actual term for this idea, which is so prevalent in our society. It all ties back to consumerism in the U.S., which is perpetuated through the American Dream. And yet, America is ranked 19th in the world happiness report from 2019. I really liked how Ken used details from other nations and referred to their higher status in terms of happiness to prove that high carbon emissions are not necessary to be content in life. I think this information should be more well-known because it may be able to change the perspectives of people who refuse to make changes in their lives to mitigate the climate crisis.

I really enjoyed the film, "Happy" and am glad Ken included it in the curriculum, despite it not directly addressing climate change. This film reminded me of the importance of personal action in maintaining our own well being. I was moved by the story about the woman who suffered an accident that disfigured her face, and how she was able to bring herself back into a state of grounded contentment and happiness despite the many things that she had gone through. It's stories such as these that put into perspective the lives we live. If there are people out there who have had everything taken away, who live off the absolute bare minimum, who have gone through tragedy and heartbreak and grief, and are STILL able to find happiness in life, then I can surely rid myself of some environmentally harmful parts of my lifestyle and be okay. The interesting part is, we think by relinquishing these harmful but 'vital' parts of our day to day lives, we'll be more stressed or our lives will be harder or not as fun.. or whatever. The reality, however, is that simplification always makes it easier to find happiness. By taking away some of the luxuries we deem crucial to our well-being, we're allowing ourselves to not be bound by them anymore, which in turn means we have more control over our life and a clearer path to lasting happiness. We have become so tied to our Earthly possessions that we forget how little they actually matter. The only way to beat the Hedonic treadmill is to get off it. People in the U.S. are rabid, insatiable consumers, looking to fill voids and insecurities and false constructions of joy through any and all superficial means. The thing is, it never works, so why not seek joy directly? If not for the environment, do it for yourself, simplify living for your own happiness.

I think the film really shows that a lot of Americans we take our happiness for granted. I really agree with what you said in your comment about letting go of some of the items we deem to be luxury goods in order to free ourselves from them. There is a certain toxicity that comes with staying attached to things that we think should make us happy as they often do not end up fulfilling our desires. As you also said I think this film doesn't need to emphasize the environment. People should try and live happier lives and then as a very positive side effect the world will get better. I also agree that simplification does make life easier. I think the main reason is it gives you very few things to have to worry about and reduces the stress on your mind and soul so you can live a clearer life.

The documentary “Happy” was very heartwarming to watch. I loved watching the stories of individuals who found their way to happiness in their own unique way. I was very interested in the scientific reasoning behind happiness, and the different ways in which dopamine can be released. I also found an interesting point to be that extreme feelings of being ecstatic and devastated only last short periods of time.

<br><br>

However, I don’t necessarily think that I can apply all the strategies that the people in the documentary explained. For example, I find it very hard to imagine being happy in a cohousing community. I don’t think that I could be around so many people for so much time. I enjoy eating dinner with just my own family, and I believe that having alone time and privacy is very important. This definitely emphasizes the fact that everybody finds their happiness in their own ways. Cohousing communities help people in Denmark, but I don’t think they would be beneficial for me. We should all strive to be happy, and I think “Happy” really opened up my eyes to new ideas.

I definitely agree with you! I also really enjoyed watching "Happy" and listening to different people talk about what they've been through and what makes them happy. Seeing how these people have gone through things that others would possibly  hear and see and probably think that those people are probably really sad, but instead these people took their adversities and grew from them which I found really inspiring.

I also agree with you that all these strategies would not work for everyone, I also really value my privacy and space and would probably be pretty unhappy living in a co-housing community although I definitely see the appeal and how some could really benefit from it. I think this film showed a diverse way of lifestyles but really underlined the fact that in order to have some happiness was to surround yourself by people you love and do things you love such as hobbies or helping others.


<br><hr>
Like you, I also enjoyed watching Happy, the documentary focused on various aspects of the word in terms of finding that self-happiness and I also very much liked watching the section of the film that dealt with the scientific side of how and why it is we feel happy. One of the quotes that stood out to me from the documentary as it has been told by friends and family members is “to go out and seek experiences that make you happy (release dopamine). This was overall a much more light-hearted and positive documentary to watch, one that contained several influential messages and hope people can act upon. As we know the way we feel about ourselves and our perspective on our world is important because it directly incites the actions we push forward. 

<br><br>

I’m also glad you mention how it is you wouldn’t necessarily find comfort let alone happiness in several of the strategies people were able to find happiness in. I think this is important because not everything is for everyone but maintaining a mindset that allows for us to make more positive actions to create a better social and physical environment. Co-housing has so many benefits not only because of the impact it can have on climate change but as we saw peoples’ overall lifestyle, however if it isn’t for you, I’d look for another way to better our planet via one’s comfortability and happiness ofcourse keeping in mind that there is always good reasoning for making personal sacrifices.

<br><br>

I lastly want to make the point that my personal favorite part of the film was that of the kids in school being brave and vulnerable enough to share how it is they have been affected by the comments and actions of their peers. It just goes to show that our words and how we treat people can have a much bigger impact on people than we may expect and that treating people with respect and compassion should always be a priority.
<br><hr>

I also found this film very moving to watch. It may not be directly related to climate change and how to combat the issue, but by illustrating the stories of people who overcame obstacles and found happiness. The explanation of karoshi in Japan particularly stood out to me, because it wasn’t just a small group of people being mistreated and deprived of their individual happiness, but a wealthy nation full of them. And it isn’t labeled as mistreatment because the entire country is expected to over-work themselves. 
<br><br>


Stories like these truly show us how we don’t need excess clothes, food, mansions, and other unnecessary belongings to make us happy. Depicting the kind of lives that people in Denmark have was very inspiring because it proves that that kind of lifestyle is not only completely possible, but also can lead to a life of fulfillment and happiness. 
<br><br>


I felt the same as you about living in co-housing communities, but I think I would consider trying that kind of lifestyle for some time just to see what it’s like. This film really showed us what it means to be happy by combating the idea that we need lots of stuff and money in order to be happy. Although I believe to a certain extent, money does buy happiness, I think I have a much clearer idea of what other things in life that could bring about happiness.

<br><hr>
I agree that the film was very moving to watch as it showed the different happiness that people have. Happiness is indeed different to everyone but most of the time money isn't true happiness. The film highlights that happiness is spending time with loved ones and supporting those that you care about. Ken picked the film so that we can see another reason why people are continuously trying to profit from the planet. Society has drilled it in our heads that money will cure all your problems; to have the big mansion, the fast cars, and the luxuries vacations. However, that definition is not true because happiness is different for everyone. So if money is someone's happiness it might not be the same for the next. People are extorting the planet for monetary gain because they believe that money will bring them happiness. The idea that money will cure your problems is wrong because humans keep wanting more and wanting the things that they don't have. Materialistic objects will not bring people happiness but the film mentions that the connections we make with other people are the thing that brings us true joy. The film Happiness was created to showcase that happiness is different for everyone and that most of the time the answer isn't always money.

I have now seen this film twice and enjoyed it equally both times. I always find it interesting to look at how other people around the world live and what their lifestyles include, don't include, and how happy they are. At first, I was wondering why we would watch this film for a course about the climate crisis, but it soon made sense to me. People living in poverty can be just as happy or happier with much less "stuff". They might not own cars, have only a few articles of clothing, use barely any electricity, but are still happy. Many other places, especially the U.S can take a lesson from these people and realize we can be happy without material things and without destroying the planet due to selfishness. 
<br><br>
Happiness is relative, so it does make the issue a bit more complicated than it seems on the surface. A lot of talk about a countries average happiness was discussed, but I am curious as to how these results were taken and organized into levels of happiness. Regardless, I do think a good and happy life can be had while living without too many "luxuries". I think it is hard in America for people to be happy a lot of the times because we are sold a lifestyle of luxury and materialistic things from a very young age by big companies and corporation who just want to get business. This is seen through advertisements, tv shows, video games, and many other outlets. It leads us to be on a chase for the next best thing and if we do not have it, It causes stress and worrying about how we can get it. The American dream has become a method to create greedy people who want more things so that the economy can flourish, despite how it can hurt people's personal well-beings and affect the earth and even people across the world who feel the effects of climate change for no good reason other than our greed. This movie is a good reminder that life is about more than money and things, but about people close to us and what makes us happy. One moment in the movie that made me really think about what is important was in the first part of the film when the rickshaw driver was talking about how no matter how tough his day was, when he came home and saw his son welcome him, he felt like the luckiest man on earth. This made me very happy to see and made me realize how much joy can be brought by the little things in life.
<br><br>


Personally, I have grown up very privileged to not have to worry about my next meal, a home, clothes, or many other things. Usually what I asked for I got. I feel like this has made me become accustomed to a certain lifestyle that keeps me wanting the "best of the best". I still want a nice big house, a few cars and other luxuries. I know people may say they do not make me happy, but for me some of these items do. One of my biggest joys in life is cars and the automotive community, so for anyone to say it isn't true because they are just things, is wrong. I still believe things CAN make people happier, not ultimately happy, but happy-er than without them. If this way of thinking is "wrong" then so be it, if I feel that something makes me happy, then thats all that matters at the end of the day. Happiness is relative and can come in many different forms. This movie is a good reminder to be appreciative of what we have no matter what situation we are in. Especially, if we are able to be taking courses at UCSB, we have it better than most people in the world.

I also loved the message in the movie about how happiness is relative, and not tied to material things.  I really enjoyed seeing the lives of all these different people, and the means by which they gain their happiness.  I definitely agree with your point that while some material things can bring happiness, these things are not enough for you to be completely happy throughout your life.  Happiness is born from a combination of things, a big part of which is doing what we love. Material things can definitely contribute to it, but cannot sustain it.

The film Happy allowed for a reflection on the idea of cultural change in the US. When people ask me what I want in life, I too respond “to be happy”. Seeing how humble the poor people of India are and how content they are with the little they have, makes me realize I take what I have for granted; I know that I don’t need most of the items that I own. The people in the film also tend to find their own happiness, like the man in Louisiana, through stillness and nature. It was not a surprise that many believe money will bring them happiness; studies have shown that as economic growth has increased, happiness remains static. As Ken also mentioned, the Countries that rank low in wealth such as Costa Rica rank higher than the US in happiness. This comes to show that we Americans are praising the wrong source. The film shows that it is possible to live simply and help our environment; none of the people are living in deprivation. These people are able to live a simple life in which we are trying to adapt into our culture with no problem. They find themselves to be happier as they hold a bigger connection with their community; there was a desire for personal growth, relationships, and to help out their community. I think these desires are what we need, to be able to combat the climate crisis. It is possible to practice limitation, remain happy, and reduce our carbon footprint.

This week’s film Happy is great to me. Instead of talking about environmental issues directly, it shows us how to live a better life. Nowadays, the competitions are becoming more and more severe everywhere in the world. However, can we be happy while being under so much factual pressure from the society? It is hard to define. There are lots of clashes between being happy and being well for lots of people. For example, lots of students wanted to have fun instead of just studying. Therefore, it is obviously happier for them to have fun everyday and avoid caring about their grades. However,  it can have negative influences on their life span. But does study really means unhappy? The answer is clearly no. We are separate individuals, and we have different hobbies. I think the core is we need to find out what we need and what we want to pursue. And don’t let wrong direction of your pursue destroy justice or what you value. And eventually, happiness will come to us .

I would like to just say that so many wealthy people I personally know are extremely unhappy - just seeing from real life experiences - compared to their “poorer” counterparts. The more someone wants, the less they feel like they have, because once you chase material things it is impossible to have everything. When people in general focus their efforts on attaining more “stuff” and putting value in whether or not they have something, they will always need to have better things and more things to keep them updated and look rich. However, this just leads to an empty end and a never ending chase to something you can never achieve. There is only so much that having more material items can do for someone, and while it can work to fill emptiness in the rare person’s life, it mostly just causes sadness and emptiness. 
<br><br>


The people who I know are very happy and satisfied are the ones that are filled spiritually and mentally.  When someone actually focuses their effort on doing productive things that can benefit their mental health, everything changes. I have seen in real life that when people change their mindset, and focus on mentally productive activities, their whole attitude can change for the better. Personally focusing on what makes me happy instead of what I think will make me money has been a life changing experience. I have seen first hand what chasing money looks like and how unfulfilling it is. Having more is definitely not always better, and in most cases, money cannot buy happiness. It is really not worth sacrificing happiness for material wealth, especially when we know that it is detrimental to the environment. It is just all around not a great idea!

It’s interesting to find out that what we think makes us happy, money and social status only accounts for around 10%. Another 50% is based on genes, and 40 % is the actions that we partake in. For instance, the movie gives examples of people who seem happy, chill when they’re out in nature. This reminds me of Chris McCandless, real life character from the book Into The Wild, how he abandoned his conventional job, go on a trip across America, to Alaska, and he said he was happy in his journal. That has changed my perspective about my daily actions. I don’t stress so much about grades anymore, I do want to pursue my bachelor, but I also want to spend time doing other things I like, spending time with friends, go sightseeing and watch movies. Other stories, I find really moving, is the brave lady, who survived the truck accident. She was able to recover, and live a happy life despite the unfortunate event. It was her choice, her action, that gets her going and living happy.

For this week’s film “Happy”, I found that it’s interesting of what cases will make us happy. In this film, I was quite surprised that the U.S. is the nineteenth happiest country around the world. In the past, I used to think that the one with more money or reputation will be happier than those who is poor. However, this film completely changed my view towards it. Moreover, I found that the happiness is directly related to the job the one works. If the working hours is long, workers will be unhappy. Like Japan and America, with long working hours, people are not happy comparing those whose working hours are short, like Sweden. Also, if the work is not favorable to the workers, even if they earn a lot of money, it won’t be a reason for them to be happy.

Yeah, I could relate to this within my family. You brought up the fact that those who work more hours tend to be more unhappy. I have twin uncles, one of whom is a workaholic. He tends to be more mellow and but also more stressed about work all the time. Even when it comes to something outside of work, he tends to stress rather than go with the flow. My other uncle is much more chill and relaxed and only puts into his work what he needs to. He is more fun to be around and tends to not overthink much when it comes to a problem in his work or in his life. The more stressed uncle even lives in Canada and has a well paying job, but he is no happy as the one still living in India. I want to be like my more relaxed uncle and be able to focus on my life and my family instead of my work. I know it is a very annoying cliche but I want to work to live not live to work.

I think that the film "Happy" highlighted something that is very evident within the society that exists in the United States. I find that, as Ken said, the American Dream is identified by who receives the most money, fame, and works the hardest. I think that we depend on others' opinions and use their feelings towards us to rate our lives. I think India is also a very judgmental place, on par with the United States, if not worse, and to watch that rickshaw driver talk about how happy he is living where he does and working for his family while simultaneously spending time with them as much as he can was a very humbling experience. I think that the desire for affection and compassion with families and friends has increasingly become a society where your worth is deemed upon your accomplishments in America. While this might have changed culturally, chemically, humans still require dopamine and serotonin in order to be happy. These will only be gained through a cultural shift with a focus on taking care of one another.

In “Happy” I think the most influential thing for me was seeing how other people lived in other countries. I believe that the film demonstrated a very important point when they showed places like Denmark, Nabia, and Okinawa. Denmark, being the happiest country on Earth, had a lot of people living in co-housing communities and showed how happy they are there because the community shares chores, highlighting how serving others makes you more happy. Also, it was interesting to hear that the happiest country in the world provided free college and health care for life… perhaps America should take some notes… I also really enjoyed the simplicity of places like Nabia and Okinawa because they illustrated that the key to happiness is spending time with one another and serving others before yourself. I found it interesting, as well, when the film was showing people who were truly happy and what they were doing with their life, and they were not a college student, nor someone working in a field that required at least a bachelor's degree. These movies kind of want people to live simpler lives (which is great, I totally agree), but those lives have no career in them that say “once graduating college you will live a life of success and happiness”. To be completely honest, these films low key want to make me drop out because it seems like by getting a bachelor's degree and working at a corporate job will make me hate my life and contribute to the climate crisis and die anyways. Well, that’s just something to think about.

I agree with you on these types of films making me question my degree in the first place, and then I remind myself that we I am a woman getting an education and that is privilege in itself. I feel like the point necessarily wasn’t to make us drop out of school, but rather reevaluate why we are in school. I feel like the point of this documentary, especially when drawing comparisons to Denmark, is that the people have jobs, but their jobs are not their lives. They are qualified to work, they just work less and focus more on themselves and their communities. It is possible to work and be passionate about what you do but also contributing to mitigating the climate crisis by becoming activists, voting, etc. 
<br><br>


Most of us who live in America have grown up with the idea that money means happiness. Well, that is not true and this documentary very well displayed that. A place like Bhutan was unheard of to me. The fact that they work on gross national happiness and it was the responsibility of the government to provide that made me hopeful yet envious. Comparing America to Okinawa and Nabia, it was clear that the American version of happiness is detrimental to the planet. Not only does it focus on the capitalistic market, modern culture influences our thoughts about what happiness should be. There is a lack of social bonding and an abundance of ego in America and because of that, intrinsic goals and personal growth is not as important. 

<br><br>

This film was quite hopeful and uplifting compared to some past films. With the comparisons between Japan, Nabia, Denmark, families in Louisiana,  and even those faced with terrible situations emphasized that a culture of happiness is plausible…. We just need to rethink how we can achieve that.


<br><hr>

I had a very similar reaction to yours. It was incredible to see how people all over the world live better, happier lives in situations that most Americans would deem uncomfortable or poor. Like you said, almost all of the people that were interviewed did not have traditional education and did not make 5 or 6 figure salaries, but they were incredibly happy. They have better health, more compassion and live longer and their lifestyles deviate almost completely from the traditional American life. This film made numerous arguments for personal health and wellbeing, but I think it also highlighted many things we can do to combat climate change. From co-housing in Denmark to growing your own food in Okinawa, it seems that things that make you happy can also make the environment happy. While it is unlikely that we will totally change the mindset of the entire US, this film makes it clear that happiness doesn't come from consumption and monetary wealth, in fact, only 10% of your happiness comes from that. 
<br><br>

The constant hustle that comes with the US's version of happiness is not worth it -- not for us and not for our planet.



<br><hr>
 I really appreciated your comment. I also enjoyed the way the film depicted the different lifestyles in other countries and cultures. Oftentimes I think we get wrapped up within the bubble of our community, our society, and our culture, we forget that there are other ways to approaching life that can be just as rewarding, if not more fulfilling. 

<br><br>

Your sentence about wanting to drop out because a corporate job seems unfulfilling really resonated with me. I feel like the inner conflict of pursuing your dream and ideal vs. the reality of doing what needs to be done to obtain financial security/prosperity is probably a common but deeply troubling dilemma. I can most certainly relate.

It was interesting to watch this film which discussed the pursuit of happiness in other parts of the world in contrast to the United States. Here we try amassing material goods such as nice cars, large houses, and lots of fancy clothes. This is the path to happiness prescribed by our culture; however it is not effective. People who have lots of money are not guaranteed to be happier than a person who does not.
<br><br>
It made me reflect on what I view as personal happiness. While making lots of money has never been my ultimate goal, I thought that being upper middle class was my personal goal for happiness. However, now I think that it is more important to find a job that I love doing and surrounding myself with people that I enjoy being around.

<p>
WHOLESOME! The only word I could use to describe the whole film. Throughout viewing, I found myself smiling at so many scenes and it genuinely brought me joy and hope. Even though 50% of happiness could be traced back to genetics, we are still responsible for the other half based on who we are, what we do, and where we live. I’ve always known that happiness is related to dopamine, but I did not know that we start to lose dopamine synapses as we age. This reminded me of do what you love, and you will never work a day in your life. I do think it’s so important to be “in the zone” and just enjoy the moment. During that time, you won’t be stressed, nor will you be worried. Being appreciative and grateful will not only bring you happiness, it will make you feel more grounded and more connected to everyone and everything around you. 
<br><br>

It’s my first time hearing the term “hedonic treadmill” and it’s a principle that has been adopted by the modern life. We are always comparing ourselves to others. We want more and we want to be better. However, this cycle will only lead us to our downfall at our planet’s cost. I do think that our intrinsic goals will complement our extrinsic goals. Without a good foundation for the intrinsic goals, we will not be able to establish good extrinsic goals. And together, they can bring us happiness, but not without the other. I’ve always known Japan as a fast-paced country. However, recent years due to the epidemic of Karoshi, a lot of companies are starting to adopt a 4-day work week and they do find employees to be more productive. In turn, these companies are doing better than others. I think inherently compassion will be the key to a lot of issues we face today. Without compassion, fossil fuel interests will never recognize what they have done to humanity even if it’s right before their eyes. With compassion, we could change the world for the better and treat our environment the way it should be treated.

I couldn't agree more with the word you chose to describe this film. I too caught myself, several times, smiling at my screen and finding small moments of joy from the individual stories depicted in the film. I found it very interesting that 50% of happiness can be traced back to our genetic hardwiring and that only 10% is related to our careers or social status. Based on the way our society prioritizes happiness through our profession or wealth, I would have thought that the 10% would have been more. Even still, I am extremely glad that the remaining 40% is in our control: our actions and who we are. I too was only aware about the effects and function of dopamine in our bodies and didn't know that we start to lose dopamine synapses as we age. It was very interesting to learn more about the way our brain works to create happiness, but even more enjoyable to see people taking their happiness into their own hands.
<br><br>

I specifically felt connected to the concept of being "in the zone" that was brought up in the film. It was described as the way that athletes feel when they are working on their craft; in the moment and solely focused on what you are doing. I feel this kind of happiness every time I dance. Even if I am just at practice going over our latest routine or in class working on my technique, the type of adrenaline rush I get while doing anything dance related makes the rest of the world go away. I feel as if dance and what I am doing in that exact moment is the only thing that matters. The second I walk into our practice space or onto a stage, I am only meant to be a dancer. This feeling has always been my escape and especially here at UCSB, dance has helped me maintain my stress and feelings of missing home. I feel like a better person when I am dancing and I always look forward to the feeling it gives me when I perform. Watching this film made me appreciate what I do so much more and reminded me that I need to strive to have that feeling in my life for the rest of my time on this planet. As said in the film, people who experience this “flow” are much happier than people who don’t. As simple as this sounds, I feel like in this day and age, it is a lot harder for people to hold onto their flow. The American Dream is now centered on “wanting more, wanting bigger, and wanting better” instead of wanting what truly makes you happy and brings meaning to your life. What makes this even worse is what Ken brings to our attention in this video: our pursuits of happiness are in fact destroying the planet. I appreciate the spin that Ken put on the film and I encourage everyone to really take a look at their life and reflect on whether or not they are pursuing true happiness.

Everyone wants to be happy. In the United States, we are constantly told that the key to happiness is buying more materialistic items and becoming the richest person in the country. After watching this film, I can see that this is not the case at all and in fact, it sometimes makes me feel unfilled. Every time I order something on Amazon, I get extremely excited and happy that my item arrived, but maybe after a day or two, my happiness goes away and I am back to my sad, depressed self. 
<br><br>


This film has shown that the true path to happiness is having less and doing more that you love. Spending time with your friends and family creating memories is worth more than any amount of Gucci you can afford. I’ve always pondered that what if we are working too much and if we had more time to dedicate to ourselves and relationships with others, would life be different? In countries such as Switzerland where the average workweek is about thirty hours compared to the United States at fifty hours per week. That is literally almost an extra day of work that people in the United States are putting in that could be used for resting for the following week. It is insane. As human beings, I do not think we should have to work our lives away; there is so much to explore, learn, experience and be a part of.

<br><br>

It is amazing how the poorest countries around the world are much happier than US Citizens. It costs nothing. All it takes is spending time with loved ones and making memories. There had been times when I deleted my social media because I felt as if I was not living my best life because I was out eating at expensive restaurants with friends or if I did not have trendy clothes. It’s almost as if it seemed this was the life I am supposed to live. Though I am back on social media, these breaks were definitely much needed and I felt great during those periods. Another astonishing detail from the film was that over 40% of our happiness comes from our own personal actions. That means that almost half of our happiness depends on what we do. I definitely need to reconsider how I live my life because I too want to become happy.

This documentary was especially eye-opening to me because I grew up in a household and a culture that put happiness last. It is what I witnessed first hand growing up, and what I was lectured my whole life. My parents immigrated here from a poor asian country with not much money or family here, and they managed to raise me and my sister and build reasonable careers. They never received government assistance because that was seen as being "shameful" because no one should have to ask for help like that. Through seeing this as a child and my mom's many lectures, I have learned that I should work hard and do everything I can to become successful, in most cases my happiness will come last. I was told that following what I wanted to do would shame them and our family, so my career should only be something that would bring money to the family. Growing up and seeing them work day and night to make basic rent and food money, definitely drove me to want to make them proud, luckily my interests are in the medical field. However, my sister chose communications as her major and for a while, my parents simply could not accept that, and it almost came to the point where she was almost disowned, even though she still planned to stay in college and get a Bachelor's degree. Being raised on these ideals and it being basically embedded in our culture, this documentary was strange for me. 
<br><br>
Other than that, I do believe that lowering our carbon emissions would come hand in hand with increasing happiness. Because our main focus as Americans is currently materialism and capitalism, we are trapped on the hedonistic treadmill. By shifting our focus from material items to our intrinsic values and simplifying our lives, I feel that our ignorance and selfishness would fade.

Hey thanks for sharing this personal story. I think with you a lot of people do not get the opportunity to put their happiness first. One of the main causes, that also coincides with your explanation as I read it, is that people have to work so hard that there is little time left for other things. Also there are many cultural differences and shame is one of the main pillars of some cultures that drives being unhappy. Happiness requires openness and a feeling you have choice, this is fundamental for feeling fulfilled and connected to you desires. I hope you get the chance to develop this more. I sounds like you have a really good meta-view of the situation and like you are a rational influence for your parents. As for your point on the climate crisis I agree that living with less emission will definitely stimulate the happiness for one simple reason, if you have less stuff and a less hectic, money driven life you will have less problems. More money, more problems, less money, less problems. The flip-side of this coin is that a lot of people are not in a position that is stable enough or does not feel secure enough to make these changes. We should try and create the right environment to do this.

I absolutely loved this week's film. It made me seriously reflect on my values and my own happiness. As I watched the film, I realized I wasn't truly happy, and I started to wonder why. I'm at a great college, I have wonderful friends, a great family, and plenty of material items. But it occurred to me that I had sacrificed a lot of my old hobbies in favor of studying and working. I used to LOVE swimming, reading books, making art, meditating, gardening, playing the guitar, but I haven't done any of these things in close to a year. It really hit me hard that my values are not where my heart is, and while thankfully I love my major and my education (so it isn't a matter of what path I'm on), I do want to incorporate these things back into my life.  This film goes to show, however, that being happy and taking care of yourself is essential to your health and well-being. This is evident by the epidemic in Japan of people literally working themselves to death, as shown in the documentary. That is insane to me. How can we live in a world where we prioritize pieces of paper over actual human beings? How could we be so cruel?
<br><br>


The fact that being happier is linked to living longer as well, we need to start being kinder and nicer to each other and invest in one another's happiness. The fact that the middle schoolers were crying about how they felt unloved and uncared for broke my heart. We need to be kinder. The people on the island and the "original" tribe all seemed so concerned with one another, and both united in times of tragedy. This behavior is something we should all share, and yet, I don't even know my neighbors' names. I couldn't tell you the first thing about them. I feel like that's an awful practice. 

<br><br>

I find that in these videos, too, that people who are more concerned with Earth's nature and outdoor surroundings and saving the climate are all so much happier and in tune with one another. Maybe there's a link there? Maybe, and hear me out, it's like we need each other to survive, and we should actually cherish one another's company? I dunno, kinda radical. Anyways, this film has definitely inspired me to take up my old hobbies, take care of myself, help the environment, and be more concerned/help others. :)

I wholeheartedly agree with you! This film was much different than any others we were assigned, and is my favorite so far. I particularly like to because it made me reflect upon my own life and the state of my mental health than contribute to it by spewing crisis facts to me that I already know. Happiness for me as a first year is much more synonymous to content. Instead of being happy, I settle for what generally brings me some kind of joy. I also agree with you in your point of sacrificing what you love for your academics. My all time favorite leisure activity was reading, and today I went with a friend on a walk around the library to see if they had 'regular' books for us to read. We both fell in love with reading, but lost it over the years as we found ourselves becoming busier and busier. Walking through the aisles of books that once held so much meaning was extremely nostalgic to me and brought upon a sense of happiness that I probably haven't felt since I was 13. I realized that I had given so much up for no reason at all, and it brought me to think about what else I was longing for now that college has taken over my life. Of course, as you grow older, you change– but I didn't realize that my values changed with it too. I hope to incorporate these things back into my life after today, and I know that I will continue to be happier if I reminensce just a little bit longer.
<br><br>

The film was extremely heartwarming in the fact that all of their happiness was real and didn't stem from materialistic things. Each person experienced something in life that could have been their downfall, but instead chose to chase happiness by creating a life for themselves that brought feelings that are uncomparable. The most gut wrenching story for me in perhaps was the woman was run over by the truck. She went from beautiful to being full of insecurity, which brought a lifetime of trauma, depression, and unsolved cases of sadness that she buried deep down. It was incredible to see that she managed to find a way out and be happy again. If I was in her place, I do not think I could have the strength to do that. All of these people held immense strength in their lives that are unmatched, and it was eye opening to see that happiness was built from love, from their family, and from their environment. These are all things that money can't buy.

The film “Happy” ties into a lot of what we’ve been saying these past few weeks about minimalism while also bringing this new and refreshing content that helps us think beyond the surface of what we need to do about climate change. Happiness comes subjectively, but I think a lot of us can agree that the pressure of being the best in terms of money and goods inhibits us from finding it. American culture makes it feel like a waste of time when we have free time because it encourages its citizens to work to the grave. Yes, work is obviously extremely important, but when the cost of living is so high and minimum wage being as it is, some people have to take up two or even more jobs. It’s hard for happiness to come to a lot of those people. On top of this, you have consumerism which is either making people spend tons of money on sometimes useless goods or feeling incompetent with themselves for not being able to afford it...or both! To say that money doesn’t buy happiness only really applies to people who want to indulge in high levels of unnecessary spending. You don’t need the best car or the newest fashion trends set to be happy. However, let’s not forget that there are a lot of people who need money for just basic living conditions. It all comes down to changing a culture that promotes the idea that materialistic things are what you need to be happy, and it especially comes down to helping those who are disadvantaged (in this sense anyways).
<br><br>

The film manages to show that even those who are disadvantaged can be happy. That’s a powerful thing and made watching the film extremely uplifting. It kind of allowed us to shift from action in terms of changing our diets to practicing something more personal and psychological so that we can grow to stray away from what we think makes us happy but are only hurting our planet. It also makes me think back to Peter and his method of using meditation. People were..oddly annoyed about that..? I find it odd that they were considering the studies that show just how big of an impact meditation can have on people. The more we practice things like that, and the more we can hopefully change consumer culture and the current state of income disparity, we’d probably be a lot happier

I like this film vey much. I have heard for a long time that NYU has this course called the positive psychology which simply teaches people how to be happy. I was wondering where I can get a course like this. And then I have got this film. ‘Happy’ really pictures the life I really want vividly- the big family live all together. In this lifestyle of slowness, people in the big family gather together every week and have meal. Everyone always has a big smile on their face that shows how happy they are. Surprisingly, the secret of happiness is, instead of money or socio-economic status, the link between family and friends. I think that is why I am feeling so happy and satisfied this quarter as I met a group of friends that really match my personality. Talking with them, I will not feel any anxiousness or tired. After my father and I reconsidered the real meaning of life, we realized that we need to be a better company to our family members. Farming on his back yard and enjoy the weekend, my father felt more joy than ever before.

Of all the films assigned, the movie "Happy" was by far my favorite. What was explained in the film about happiness is exactly what I had learned made me happy. I have suffered a lot from depression, I have noticed that a lot of times I am the least depressed when I am doing things with other people. I do not just mean talking to others, but I mean some kind of activity. For example, when I got into working out I enjoyed it, but when my friends started to workout and we worked out together was when I really was happy, it was the thing I actually really looked forward to everyday. Also, I started to seek more opportunities to be more social and do more of these activities. When my friend told me she needed dancers for her quince I forced myself to do it and it actually was very fun and I made stronger connections with my friends. Although, I still have battles with depression I know exactly what can be done to help ease the symptoms and move to being a more happier being.  I hope that we all try to become more happier beings and learn that to be happy does not mean to be rich, we can find happiness right now, it is not a faraway goal.

I do really like that you value and treasure happiness with the people that you love. I am learning to appreciate the people that I surround myself with and wisely spend my time and energy with them. The happiness I gain from their company is unmatched by anything else. Truly, I can say that nothing can even come close in comparison. I have seen people become so absorbed in the products of technological advancements and highly regarded standards of living that they lose the strong connections they have with their friends and family. I will admit that I have nearly fallen into this trap. The overarching materialistic aspect of the “American Dream” has sent people mad in finding happiness in tangible things. I know there is little I can do to change people’s perspectives on their values in this matter, but I do hope that the more that I invest my good time and energy into doing what I love with the people I love, that they can spread the message of true happiness in good spirit. It is through example that I hope to teach others and help them reconsider their priorities in life and spark self love and self improvement, which I still continue to work on and hope others will as well.

The documentary displays how people feel through a variety of inspiring ways instead of being fulfilled by materialism and money. In the beginning, psychological evidence revealed that feeling happy mostly led by genes, circumstances, and intentional actives. Genetic reasons take up 50 percent and intentional activities take up 40 percent. In other words, people are able to decide or control their happiness under most conditions. Besides, the film mostly focus on the internal goals of happiness that people feel pleasure through achieving personal growth, social relationship, and the desire to help others. It aimed to convey that getting adequate money does not equal to feeling pleasure. In Japan, people lived in urban areas have the lowest level of happiness and they spent little time with families. People were more likely to feel anxiety and depressive. However, in Okinawans, a small island in Japan, was famous for longevity and high happiness level. People cared about each other in friendly communities and shared healthy living schedule. Though they may not own much money, they are very satisfying about life and surroundings. Also, the co-housing community in Denmark provides cozy communities for people. People lived in the same building have dinners together and mothers spend less time on preparing meals. Children learn to communicate with others and their social responsibilities are developed. All the examples conveyed that people can gain happiness beyond own a lot of money. After watching the film, I felt quite optimistic since people can realize the essence of happiness. It reveals that there are a lot of ways to fulfill ourselves except consuming the substance. We can communicate with people, make more friends, and help others, realizing our values in more meaningful ways.

I really enjoyed this film, well for the most part I enjoy all of the films we watch in this class. At first, I was a little confused as to why we were watching this because the movie never talks about the importance of happiness in relation to the climate crisis, However, once watching Ken’s video, I understood. Attempting to answer Ken’s question of whether or not we are destroying the planet in the pursuit of happiness, I honestly think that we are. When the film talks about how wealth equates to happiness, I believe that that shows how many people care more about materialistic things, rather than actually doing good in this world. I also think that the film made a really good point about how a lot of people lack compassion nowadays. I feel like having compassion and serving others is very important in trying to solve the climate crisis because a big issue we have with it now is that many people from the older generation don’t want to help because it won’t concern them in their lifetime. If we learned to live our lives less self absorbed, I believe that the climate crisis would not be as big of an issue as it is right now because we wouldn’t emit as much CO2 because we would be thinking more about how it hurts others rather than just doing something because it’s convenient.

I absolutely agree that it is really influential to see how citizens of other countries are able to lead happy lives without the extensive use of fossil fuels. This summer, I visited Iceland and before I went there, I did some research on Icelandic traditions and foods. Many of the travel books and websites talked about how friendly/happy the Icelanders are and I couldn’t imagine them being any nicer than the people in California. But, I was surprised to see how happy everyone actually is in Iceland. Everyone was very welcoming and, even though they live in such a cold climate, they made me feel warm and happy to be there. This is why I can understand the fact that the happiest people on this planet live in Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands.
<br><br>

To answer Ken’s question of “are we destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness”, yes, I believe that we are. And, I agree with the fact that Americans should take notes on how other countries citizens are able to live simpler lives with better quality items, foodstuffs and so on. I also understand how Kathleen feels like dropping out of college because it is so expensive yet so taxing on each student that, by the time we get out into the workforce, we are drained and tired and have even more anxiety because now we have to balance paying off student loans, working hard towards a fulfilling career, keeping up with friends and family, and having to make difficult, adult decisions. What’s the point of all of this if we can’t even look forward to being happy later in life?

The definition of happiness is so subjective, it literally depends on the person, environment, culture, etc. I know so many people that define happiness as seeing the sunrise every day, while some need more materialistic forms of happiness. Therefore, my question is why do so many people place their definition of happiness on others? Why is it that so many cannot be content with what they have? The answer is that our society and the media has placed a price tag on happiness.

DM, I like you said that happiness has a subjective definition, this means it is attainable for every one, especially since we can all have our own nuanced definition.  This definition is shaped by a multitude of factors including the society we grow up in along with the one we are born into.   It is based on your family values, personal goals and overall priorities. What I really liked about the documentary Happy was when they broke down the distribution of influence when it came to all the factors that determine happiness. It was interesting to note that half of your subjective experience with happiness is genetic and you are predisposed to your position before you are even conscious, your body controls that for you.  Its interesting that it's split right down the middle, happiness being half something you can control and half something out of your control.  I didn't know this until now.  They mentioned that all the classic things like social status, economic status and personal condition makes up the next 10%.  The best part is knowing that 40% of our experience with happiness is shaped by our choices, the activities we choose to take part in or those we choose to not participate in.  So many things that are beneficial for the Earth are also beneficial for us, biking, planting, gardening, landscaping - even if outdoor activities don't involve anything beneficial directly, humans have adapted seemingly every event to involve the production of carbon, so hopefully having people outside would just lead to them spending time doing anything that pouring carbon into the atmosphere.  It felt good to know that I am this much in control with my feelings and overall enjoyment of life.  It makes me want to endulge in happiness more, try to share it and encourage others to participate in activities that promote improvement of global life.

This has been one of my favorite films in this class because the overarching theme was how to be happy and the benefits of living a happy life. In the film, it was stated that many people, including myself, tend to overestimate or underestimate how happy or sad situations and circumstances will make them. I agree with this, as I often think about “how if I fail this test, I will be miserable for the whole week.” This film taught me that I need to focus on the things that I can control and let things happen in life as they may, there is no point in sulking over things. In addition, I fall under the category of Americans who can’t seem to be satisfied. This hedonic treadmill truly is happiness’ weakness, as I seem to crave another thing to make me happier time after time. I need to stop being so materialistic and focus on the things in life that are truly important. When my time on Earth comes to an end, I will not bring my car or any other of my belongings to my deathbed.

I also tend to make my reason for happiness dependent on success and failure, something that my parents have called me out on time and time again. I think that this film truly did help me shift away from that negative mindset and move towards feeling satisfied with those around me, and enjoying what I have in front of me instead of fantasizing over the beauty of tomorrow. Materialistic things have never made anybody truly happy, and I think we need a bit of a culture change and a shift towards shorter work weeks and universal health care in order to prove that.

Being a college student has us many times depending our happiness on how good or bad we are doing in classes and test as we watch others succeed over us of fail. But it is important to remember that happiness should not revolve around that. Yes, it is important to want to succeed in classes and test but those thing don't bring true happiness like other things such as the people we surround our self with, being in tune with your yourself and what you value in life. Because in the end when everyone's time comes love ones will remember you not by the grades you received or didn't receive but by the memories you share and cherish together.

First of all Ken, I really appreciate that you are ending the quarter on this note, happiness. Studying environmental studies as well as many other humanities can get very depressing, just focusing on what is going wrong. There is always the positive side, the idea that we can do something and be the change however it still is a lot to think about all the time, the potential doom of our planet. 
<br><br>
In order to be happy, we must seek out opportunities that release dopamine, which is often physical activities. This idea can be  difficult though, I have recently picked up surfing and it is super fun. I want to keep going and surf all the time, but I am conflicted with what I feel like is my social responsibility to help those less fortunate who do not have the opportunity to spend their life surfing if they so desire. I want to save the planet for my generation and future generations, I want to create social equality among the world. I want to help make medical care and education free. I don't want to work on environmental injustice. But also want to be happy and have fun. I am working on the balance.
<br><br>
People overestimate the time period of their future sentiment, they think they will be really happy for a really long time if something good happens, or if something bad happened they think they’ll be very sad for a very long time. This is not reality, people's sentiments last for much shorter than they expect. 
<br><br>
I find the idea of the Hedonic treadmill very interesting.  Whatever we have we get used to and want more. I feel like I have definitely experienced this in my life.

I agree that at times it can get depressing in a sense that we only look at the negatives of the problem and become so overwhelming that we start to feel hopeless. I enjoyed this film as it talked about happiness, and the different aspects of it. Peoples definition of happiness are different some are simply by living while others are by having a lot of things and stuff, so they think that success and wealth will provide happiness. I think that this film made me reflect on the things I need in order to be happy, I do not need a brand new car, the latest I phone, etc. but as long as I am happy with myself and the things I NEED at the same time I can save the planet.

The film “Happy” put a lot of things into perspective. It made me realize the importance of having people who are supportive and caring for you in your life, rather than having a job that simply makes you miserable. It was really eye-opening to see how Japan is the least happiest country in the world simply because people are literally working themselves to death. This is due to the idealization of western culture and how we find money as a means of success and happiness. The opening scene with the man from India was so wholesome. He knows he’s not the richest man, but his happiness from his family makes him feel rich. That’s how we should view happiness, not through money and possession and status, but being surrounded by people who care and love us for who we are. Watching the film made me realize how toxic the idea is of how money means happiness. Happiness is such a major topic in society. From people advocating for mental health and etc, no one seems to be talking about how in society today, we view happiness through consumerism. From social media, we are influenced by influencers and celebrities that happiness is found though buying things we truly don’t need. 
<br><br>
I think this film made a really good point. We should all rethink things that actually make us happy. Sure buying things brings some sense of happiness, however, it’s not long lasting. It’s the close-relationships and connections with others that truly brings us happiness.

To me, I don’t feel happy if I am surrounded by plenty of personal items. I think having a sense of satisfaction is when you get along with a bunch of interesting friends and amazing family members. I mean most of what we get is “mental” satisfaction, while physical satisfaction is only a short-period-of-time thing. In terms of happiness versus climate crisis, I agree with the facts and statistics, saying that the happiest countries on the planet are consuming far less amount of greenhouse gas emissions to the environment. This is a meaningful comparison, where it can be easier for people to realize the fact that possessing more assets and money results in more happiness is not true. The film brings me so much new understandings and realizations that I have not yet experienced throughout my lifetime. It talks about how a person can influence himself or herself to live happily every day. Therefore, to respond to your comment, this film really makes us rethink how each of us, an individual, obtains happiness and kindness differently, and moreover, things that actually make us happy is then the true value we should be seeking for.

I really enjoyed this film. Not going to lie, a lot of the movies I've watched for this class have felt like major schoolwork, with very academic messages and terms making it like work. This movie, however, was not that. It made me genuinely happy while watching it. This is the type of documentary I'd sit down and watch on my own time because it interests me so I'm glad that this documentary was a school assigned one.
 <br><br>

I found it very interesting how much they talked about the statistics of happiness. Like 50% of your happiness is from your genes and that you really can't change. That means that all of the things on tv and all of the products that are currently being shoved into our faces every day are what is making up a good percentage of what we deem as happiness. If we all spent more time focused on ourselves and things that we don't have to buy or be the best at we'd all be much happier.

I agree with you, this film was much easier to watch and forget that I was doing it for classwork. Beyond being interested in the climate crisis, this film dives into happiness and what causes it, as you pointed out. 50% of our happiness is reliant upon external forces, and it really isn't surprising when you think about how receptive we are to positive and negative attention. 

 <br><br>

Our society revolves around gratification from others and the desire to fit in, and the media is where we look for the mold we all try so desperately to fit into. If we aren't successful, rich, and attractive like the people in the ads are, we feel bad about ourselves and, often times, feel motivation to work harder towards that goal, as if the unrealistic expectations set for us are in any way reachable. We buy what the celebrities market to us because we correlate their success with the product, and we already know success (i.e. money) is what we are taught will give us satisfaction and happiness. Breaking from this mold and spending "more time focused on ourselves" is a lot easier said than done, especially when working is a requirement in our lives. We cannot help but give into this cycle of earning money to spend it because a lot of the money we spend is actual vital for us to continue living with a roof over our heads and food on the table. It would probably be easier for the media to adjust the image of a successful person away from the amount of money they have.

After watching this week’s film, “Happy”. I was able to explore the true meaning behind happiness. The film humbled me in a way that it reminded me the hard work and struggles that my grandparents overcame just to live in this country full of happiness and opportunities. Thus, the concept of ‘American Dream’. Up to this date, I still recall the story that my grandfather told me, he told me that he sold everything that he built back in the Philippines, he literally sold his land, house, farms, cows, and horses just so he could provide a flight ticket for my family to immigrate to the United States. He will always tell me this story to remind me to not take everything for granted and that he wants me to fulfill my own dreams because he failed to fulfill his for the sake of our family’s future, in order for us to live in this country filled with ‘happiness’ and ‘opportunities’. As a result, I had to reflect on what I am really doing, the purpose of my life and why am I doing it.I thought that I am able to achieve happiness if I pursue money and that I will know that I have fulfilled my dreams when I have an abundance amount of money. Although money could be a great tool to have, I realized that it will never result in happiness.
 <br><br>
 Be grateful on what you actually do have instead of chasing all this money and fame since when you get it you understand how little it matters compared to real love. It’s the human disease of greed, never being satisfied, always wanting more. Hence, you will never find true happiness.
 <br><br>

Overall, I believe that leaning towards the idea of reducing carbon emission will break humanity’s inhumane pattern of materialism and consumerism. Climate crisis is a ‘vibe check’ to all humanity in seeking true happiness, which could only be achieved by loving yourself and loving the world you're living in.

In his YouTube video, Ken basically told you that happier countries are ones that emit less global greenhouse gas emissions. This gave me insight to an interesting connection to the film “Happy”. The film showed a clan in Namibia that likes very closely to how our ancestors did many centuries ago. This clan seemed to be very happy and emitting very little CO2 into the atmosphere. This made me connect back to the idea that the average CO2 in the air has been raising at a rapid rate since it has been being measured. This totally makes sense, because people in the early years of hunting and gathering did not emit very much CO2, just as this clan in Namibia does not emit much Co2 today either. 
 <br><br>
The main topic of interest for me in this film was the idea of externs of goals and interns of goals. They explained externs of goals as being focused on rewards, praise, and getting something such as money, success, an image, or status. Reversely, interns of goals were explained as being focused on internal and personal growth through close connectedness with others and community feelings. This made me think about how we could all be a little happier if we focused more on our interns of goals, rather than adding to our externs of goals by buying a big house, owning a bunch of cars, having a lot of children, etc. In turn, we could all be more happy and save the environment while doing it. The problem is, many people are focused on externs of goals to bring them happiness. We must shift society to think more like that clan in Namibia and work on being more happy and emitting less CO2.

Happy explores the pursuit of happiness by showing different communities of people across the globe and how what they are doing effects their overall happiness. Researchers are interviewed in between segments of different cultures to provide scientific backing to what is observed in these communities. 
 <br><br>
One of the major points that surprised me is introduced early on in the film. It is stated that 50% of what we understand as happiness is determined by genetic makeup and only 10% is based on situational circumstances (money, job, etc.). The other 40% is determined by intentional activity - doing things that actually bring intrinsic happiness to ourselves. The three major categories of intrinsic goals are personal growth, relationships, and desire to help others. On the opposite end of the spectrum we have extrinsic goals that do not invoke long-term happiness like money, image, and status. Most of these extrinsic goals are closely related with consumerism and rampant consumption, which are some of the main drivers of the current environmental crisis. I think in order to solve some of the environmental issues we will need a culture shift that evaluates happiness and focuses more on the idea of living by intrinsic goals. 
 <br><br>
For me, this film was enlightening and very relevant as to where I am at in life being that I am graduating in the spring. It touches upon career choice and focusing on choosing things to do that make you happy and along with that will come the "success" that we all are looking for. This is something that I am coming to terms with and am taking to heart as I start the next chapter of my life post-graduation.

I found the section on Okinawa to be a glaring contrast to the stories of businessmen on the main island. The fact that there is a women's choir whose members are widows of men who died from overwork is truly tragic. I have always admired the work ethic of Japan but now I understand it comes at a glaring price. I loved the section on the Okanawans.m They all seemed so wholesome and happy. Everyone seemed to be happy and energetic, especially the elderly population. 
 <br><br>
I have always believed that the ultimate goal in life should be to surround yourself with people you love and care about, and anything on top of that is an added luxury. I have been fortunate enough in my life to never know much financial strain and as a graduating senior, already have a job lined up for me that could hypothetically support me for the rest of my life.  With that being said I have prioritized being close to those I love for the next steps of my life and I hope it is able to translate to a happy lifestyle for years to come.

I really enjoy the film “Happy”. When I see people smile and laugh in the film, I will also unconsciously smile and laugh. The facts that 50% of happiness comes from gene and only 10% of happiness is related to our circumstances, like income, social status, and where you live, are interesting since before watching this, I would also think that money, rewards, and fame that people pursue could bring them happiness. I was moved by the story of the beautiful woman and one sentence that she said is really impressive for me: “you could choose to be happy”. Yes, happiness is not from the external, or extrinsic materials. It comes from the intrinsic values and pursuits, like relationships, personal growth, and desire to help. In this case, the activities and actions we choose will not only bring us happiness but also enhance our inner values and make our lives meaningful and pleasant. Life in Denmark is really attractive and the living style that many families live together and have steady relationships with neighbors and friends is what I am looking forward to. Moreover, as mentioned in the film, society always misleads individuals to pursue higher positions and incomes and more fancy and expensive products. I believe that people should really rethink about the pursuits of happiness and what actually makes them happy, truly happy.

I also really enjoyed this film. I was super interested in the breakdown in percentages of happiness and it actually really surprised me that 50% of someone's happiness comes from a gene. It's always so nice to assume that your own happiness is in your control. I completely agree that happiness can be internal. Relationships, growth, doing something meaningful, etc. I agree that although we are told that higher positions and incomes will make us happier, and I believe that after a certain amount of income you're really not all that much happier, but I also think that for some people striving for the promotions and doing work that's meaningful to them and being rewarded for it can also contribute to someone's happiness. I find it so interesting how other people live and how people live together, or that they are even close with their neighbors at all. I have never grown up somewhere where I was able to have neighbors and the ones I did have I wasn't even close to or had a conversation with until moving into the dorms at college. I can see how it would be fun and make people happier, however, I can also see how some people may be very against a lifestyle like in Denmark. I think everyone's going to have their own definition of what will make them happy and they should pursue that.

I agree with your comment - we are definitely misguided with what we believe makes us happy. We believe that we get a lot of joy from materialistic items, like new clothes or toys, but in reality, it is based on our circumstances. Sure, we get some happiness from materialism, but it is usually only temporary and/or not as beneficial for us as we think it is. I was very surprised when they said that 50% of an individual's happiness comes from his or her genes. Though we may think that we can control all our happiness, in reality, we can only control a small part of it, and the rest is based on everything around us. We can react differently to our surroundings, but innately that is what mainly changes how happy we are. This film focused on Denmark and showcased how families there were happy in the sense that they had stable lives and strong relationships with the people around them. They had a comfortable plan and a clear vision of what they wanted to do with their lives and how they were going to pursue that. We get distracted by many items and that construe our vision of what true happiness is like, and I think Ken makes an excellent statement in his video: we are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness.

I agree with you. This film persuades the audience to change the lifestyle to obtain unharmful happiness instead of materialism, which can't really help but only make our life void. The method of purchasing to gaining happiness, without doubt, is effective but at a slight level, which is not worth to do considering the true cost behind it. However, even though people know this fact, the trend of society pushing people to make more irrational purchases by hundreds of social media. In fact, as the basic requirements are met, further buying will lead to less marginal benefit. Besides, happiness is very hard to define. For homeless people, it might just be a warm place to live; for poor families, it might just be adequate food and clothing; for older singletons, it might just be someone's care. Just like the examples in the film, people can gain happiness by sharing with others, joining the group, helping others, caring environment, and being appreciated. These are the free happiness that we haven't notice. And the reason why we don't notice, I think, is our reference. Only the comparison can form the degree. We always compare ourselves with people in materials, which making us feel inferior to others.  I think we should focus on ourselves since what works for you is best.

I enjoyed watching the movie "Happy". This movie displays the difference of culture and living in other countries and how the American lifestyle has changed. Americans value materialism which does not always offer happiness. Everyone has different things that make them happy. I noticed that one thing that made everyone happy was the company of others. No one wants to be a loner with no friends. Having the love and support from others around you is great motivation and makes people happy. It was interesting to learn about dopamine, the chemical that releases happiness. Dopamine can be released from certain experiences or events. This differs between all people and one should find the thing that releases the most dopamine. We as people need to stop worrying about the random stuff going on in the world and focus on maintaining personal happiness. Do what makes you happy, even if it means you cant live a picture perfect life.

One thing that struck about the documentary "Happy" was the concept of the hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation. This theory asserts that as people make more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which ultimately results in no permanent increase in happiness. This is seen in the high level of consumerism that is prevalent in the United States, especially in the fact that the average American buys 60 new pieces of clothing every year. The fact that quality of life is increasing while happiness stays the same is mind boggling and poses a question about what is the actual income threshold that divides the happy from the unhappy. Some studies say that once income hits 50k per year, happiness levels stop increasing. So why are people still obsessed with meeting the societal expectation of financial success? 
 <br><br>

Ultimately consumerism is evidently tied to dissatisfaction and although this film wasn't environmental, it showed that those people living simpler, cleaner lives were happier overall. If anything, we Americans should be ashamed about the fact that we live much better lives and are still less happy than people who have practically nothing. Once again, Americans lack perspective. The pursuit of happiness will require a change in cultural and societal norms, and as Kenneth mentioned, we should look to the Scandinavian countries to see how they go about it. Perhaps we can start with reducing the work week and fostering a plenitude economy since it's proven that more. wealth doesn't equate with happiness.

After watching "Happy" I felt very empowered and compelled to change. The movie "Happy" is astonishingly powerful as its chief objective was to truly understand what the pursuit of happiness currently entails and what it in actuality should entail. Currently, it can be seen that the factors of many people's happiness can be attributed to materialistic objects and lifestyles. However, what the film is trying to portray is that we need to move away from the illusion of happiness. It's an illusion as once we obtain these materialistic objects we no longer feel the happiness we once did when we longed for it. Rather we extend our wants and want more materialistic objects, This then perpetuates into a consumeristic lifestyle, which truly isn't happiness. Further, as the film talks about, there are other things in life which we should value and view as inputs to our happiness. For instance, one interesting message presented in the documentary was that having belonged to a community that aligns with your values and embraces you with care/love is an essential source of happiness for most individuals. Further, having a sense of community trumps materialistic objects as the value you obtain from the community is irreplaceable whereas materialistic things are often very replicable. Beyond this, we need to truly figure out what provides us with unconditional happiness and truly create an emphasis on that part of our life.

I absolutely agree with you. Nowadays, our view and standard of happiness become more and more distorted. The advertisements of luxuries products, the TV shows of celebrities’ life, the bragging of our friends and people we know of possessing better houses and life, and all other thing have contributed our definition of happiness to become more materialistic. However, being rich and wealth and having all things you want do not truly means happiness. Many people have tried to work for their entire life in order to become rich. Many of them fail to do so and become desperate and depressed. Even some of them have success, they might eventually find out that they have nothing but money and they feel very lonely and suffered. 

 <br><br>
 
For me, being very wealth and famous do not mean happiness. It is unquestionable that money is very important because basically we need money to get most of the things we need. But I think that once you have enough and sufficient money to support your life, there is no need to pursue more. Of course, many people might say that they need a numerous of money to obtain a life they want. This is exactly the reason why they will always feel unhappy because of their unlimited desire and wants. We need to be contented. For me, happiness is living with my family and beloved ones, and pursuing personal achievements, no matter in academic studying or daily life. The documentary “Happy” is exactly accorded with my point of view.

This film reminded me how utterly unimportant it is to define success and happiness by wealth and materialistic products. Real happiness comes from the release of dopamine in our brains which happens when we are doing things we love with people we love. For many people this is physical activity and being surrounded by supportive family and friends. Scientists found that the richest most financially successful Americans are among the most unhappy in the country. Rather than extrinsic goals such as financial success, status, and image, it has been proven that intrinsic goals like personal growth and a community feeling bring a person much more joy.
 <br><br>

These findings prove that compassion and values lead to true happiness. Happiness is defined by every choice we make in which we choose to overcome rather than let it destroy us and do not create great expectations just to let ourselves down. Happiness is community, kindness, and empathy to help others. Happiness is not just a feeling but a mindset that everyone should practice in their everyday lives within all of their choices.

This comment of yours hit a little bit closer to home for me. Watching the film “Happy” I was able to truly enjoy it as it consisted of a positive outlook on life. The points that were made in the film regarding happiness were encouraging and eye-opening to me as I have once been under the impression that happiness comes from materialistic goods. Fortunately enough I am no longer convinced of this approach to happiness, but rather despise it for its falsehood. I appreciated how you mentioned how true happiness is reached through the brain because I can honestly say I cannot think of a time where I am more happy than when I am with those who I love. I agree with you strongly that value and compassion lead to true happiness in our lives rather than wealth which is a common misunderstanding, especially in today’s society. A part of the film that really stuck out to me was that it emphasized several ways to help improve your ability to obtain happiness. One that stuck out to me was to create a daily plan, a routine to follow each day to ensure that you meet certain goals as you go along. This can also be turned into a life plan to have in order to follow and accomplish what you are passionate about. It is extremely important to ensure your own true happiness and use that positive energy to contribute to the climate crisis in a positive way. It was nice to view happiness from a psychological standpoint and it was a good substitute from the usual urgent and somewhat depressing films we have seen in this class before. I strongly hope many people take this film to heart and reach their true happiness. Thank you again for stating facts in your comment for me to reply to. I am happy to see that we have a very similar stance on this topic of happiness.

Yes, we are destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness. A large portion of the average American's carbon footprint is based in the things we buy. Not only are we destroying the planet, but as seen through Karoshi in Japan, we rapidly destroy ourselves in the pursuit of fulfillment. 
 <br><br>
For a while I've wondered if it's possible to lead a truly happy life. I knew that whenever good things happen to me, I quickly return to the same emotional point as before. I didn't know that that phenomenon was called your happiness set-point until watching this. I also knew that there wasn't much of a difference between happiness levels in terms of income. What I didn't know was that our situation in life essentially only is a 10% contribution to what makes us happy. If we choose to take care of the planet as one of our intrinsic values, it'll be a significant contribution to the earth and our personal happiness when we do something beneficial for it. Similar to the happiness felt when helping out another person. If the environment is destroyed for this misled pursuit, the entirety of the U.S. and Japan will go out unhappy. If the basics of that pursuit are completely redefined, humans will live on and be happy to do so. The only issue is changing a basic concept in people's minds completely for millions of people. If buying anything for a dopamine rush was viewed as a bad idea the same way buying drugs is, there would be change.

I enjoyed this film a lot, despite it not really being directly related to the climate crisis topic. This was my first time watching “Happy” but I already feel like watching it again and even having friends or family watch it with me because it had such a nice and inspiring message behind it. I’ve always wondered what standards are set in other countries to define something as nebulous as “happiness” and this film did a wonderful job at covering that. It was especially fascinating to me how things like money and status only attribute to 10% of our happiness, since in America, those seem to be the most prominent standards that prove that someone has made it in life. While I was watching this, I started thinking of things that defined my happiness vs what currently defined my unhappiness in life. I’ve never wanted, nor will I ever want to, hoard wealth and be responsible for overconsumption; as the film showed us, those things do not bring happiness in the long term. Instead, I want to take control of my life and work towards being happy in my own way.

Happiness is only a concept, there is no definite definition for happiness. It changes with time; I remember learning about how being obese during the middle ages means that you are wealthy (therefore happy?) as back then there was a food shortage. The same works with happiness, nowadays, as we know it, being happy means owning a lot of things, making a lot of money. But deep down we all know it only makes us temporarily happy, although many of us are still tempted to buy stuff. Thus, living a minimalistic life would work, but it might not make us happy. I believe that to have a happy life, it is not only myself that need to change my way of life, but it is also everyone around me. We need to follow the same ideologies and the same mindset for things to function.

The misguided pursuit of happiness we here have in the United States, and other places around the world affected by this same tainted vision, is in fact, deeply hurting the planet as people become misguided into believing that more and more materials will make them more happier than where they are. We have this faint idea that the "American Dream", having a big massive home with lots of money, is the ultimate pursuit of happiness and this idea has spread all around the world as the United States stands a major power influence. As the film Happy shows us, happiness itself isn't rooted in these materials we have but rather 50 percent of our genetics, 10 percent in circumstances and 40 percent in our own intentional actions. This pursuit of happiness we follow under the "American Dream" is what sociologist call the 'Hedonic Treadmill', the idea that people fill in their happiness with more and more quality goods to keep the constant flow of stable happiness. In reality, what the Hedonic Treadmill reveals is that a average person will spend more and more materials to build greater carbon footprint per person just so that they can feel this happiness. In contrast to the Minimalist we saw last video where they found happiness through the little materials they own leaving a smaller carbon footprint, the pursuit of happiness under the "American Dream" creates this constant flow of materials and the ever growing carbon footprint which is substantially threatening to the planet and the lives of those working in the 3rd world nations in factories as we have seen in Bangladesh in the film The True Cost.  People become hard headed on believing the more the better and lose sight of the devastating effect of this life style since the "American Dream" has blinded people from the meaning of happiness. As the film has shown, true happiness isn't found in materials alone, as the Blanchard family, the nation of Bhutan, Melissa Moody and elsewhere, is that happiness can come from all other sorts of places through understanding, family, and balance. Nations like Japan, have fallen deeply under this belief that "American Dream" is the ultimate pursuit of happiness, which has lead to many workers in the nation to work to their own death in the belief that more work would lead to this happiness in the end, in turn hurting more than making happiness. Japan has made ways in creating the Hiroshi Hotline, yet this from a new understanding as myself is really depressing understanding that people die working too hard in this effort to reach what they believe will create happiness. 
 <br><br>
The film itself reveals a major flaw in our the "American Dream" and that is the constant flow of material goods which create a far greater carbon footprint through the constant flux of human happiness. This pursuit of happiness under the "American Dream" is affecting the rest of the world, which spikes up demands of material goods for their own happiness sake and impacts the world more and more pollution. On the personal level, it hurts individuals with lower wealth as they feel sad and depressed as their materials aren't meeting the social circumstances and results in far greater devastating effect. To fix this issue of our tainted pursuit of happiness is what Bhutan is focusing on the Growth Domestic Happiness. As statistics have shown, the growth of an economy doesn't effect the levels of happiness in the nation, as in the United States the happiness levels are on decline and nations like Japan who are a economic power having immensely low happiness levels. Nations should have a focus on the levels of happiness in the country as that is a major social factor and yet, nations may avoid this image as the "American Dream" way of happiness feeds into this economic growth aspect as the purchase of materials feeds into the economy. The overall aspect of the film, reveals to us that the "American Dream" in reality, isn't the rightful path towards happiness as happiness derives from many other places no matter your social levels.

This film was very informative on the science of being happy. What really shocked me was that genetic setup determines 50% of our happiness while circumstances only determine 10%. It was nice to see small communities who find happiness in the small things. Seeing that Denmark, one of the most environmentally conscious countries. is also the happiest makes you realize that when the environment around you is cared for you are happier. As a student and an American, it can be very hard to think that you can find happiness without money. Capitalism and society had made us believe that we need to be productive at all times and if we are not productive we are wasting time. I think watching films like these make you realize that sometimes you need to take a break and just look at everything you are grateful for. While watching the film, I had a thought that I want every person in my life to watch it because I feel that sometimes we all need a small reminder to appreciate everything in our lives.

This comment was refreshing. I watched this movie for the first time when I was a senior in high school and I loved it in its entirety. I chose to respond to your comment specifically because I liked the parts of the film that you chose to pull out and go in depth upon. The statistic that was shown , in which the film states that genetic makeup determines 50% of our happiness while circumstances equate for only 10%. It is an interesting section of the film because it goes to show the mindset and how people choose to live and handle themselves determines if a person is happy or not so much more than whatever is actually ailing them. People can choose to be happy in any circumstance and it is what people make of it. I think it is sad to see that so many people in todays day and age in the U.S. are overwhelmed with the idea that material items and things with monetary value will make them happy. It is just a statement that is so blatantly false. If there are people who have not seen this film I would urge them to do so and speak to others like this class has so generously forced us to do so. This actually forces us to see what other people think causes happiness and from this film we see that our lives and our own personal happiness is so much more of what we chose to do and not what happens to us. I loved your comment and I am glad that I had another chance to watch this film I love it and I love that other people are getting the chance to watch it in an informative class, such as this one.

Happiness cannot be bought (Happy). Joy cannot be bought (Happy). Love cannot be bought (The Beatles, “Can’t Buy Me Love”).
  <br><br>
The evidence has been gathered and presented, and it’s about time that we realize our mistake. Happiness has been made into a science (which is crazy) and the stats show that our wealth, status, and possessions only account for 10% of our happiness! Yet we continue to pursue these things as if they will be the factors that will make us most happy. They are not. Most of our happiness is in our control, through the actions we choose to undertake. Generosity, charity, and compassion will always provide us joy that will last longer than any material wealth.
  <br><br>
We have absolutely decimated our atmosphere in an erroneous pursuit of happiness. We need to face this fact and change the way we pursue happiness, and we need to do it right now. We can’t wait any longer. If we are able to shift our culture towards actions that will actually make us happy, our greenhouse gas emissions would decrease as a side effect of this. That’s so simple. We’ll be happier, and move towards saving our planet as a bonus. Easy. We did it. Now we just have to ground all the airplanes. Baby steps.

I also was reminded of this song after watching this film. I was pretty blown away that they were able to quantify exactly what percent accounts for happiness coming from different things. I was pretty surprised to find that wealth, status, and possessions account for only 10% of our happiness. It’s a little ironic that people spend their whole life chasing these things, but it only gives them a fraction of happiness when compared to many other things. I believe that materialism and capitalism are so ingrained in American culture, that it would take a lot to rid most Americans of their mentality. 
  <br><br>
 I understand that trying to shift the culture might be quite hard because many Americans haven’t experienced wealth, so it seems a little off to hear someone rich tell you that it is not the answer. There is a certain privilege that comes with having money, and that can be much more fulfilling to some people than community service or anything else. A cultural shift is needed to not only become happier but also to get rid of all of this stuff that is just creating more harmful greenhouse gases.

What I found interesting about the film “Happy” was very very cliche, but still stood out to me. The people who were obviously the happiest were those who spent time in nature and lived simpler lives. The stories of those in India, Brazil, Denmark, and Louisiana really touched me. It made me happy even just to see people who I could tell were truly happy. I realized that I have not been my happiest lately. This film made me also realize that I have shifted my priorities in a way that has been detrimental to my happiness. I have been draining myself by putting everything I have into my schoolwork and neglecting taking care of myself. I got genuinely scared and upset over the footage of the overworked Japanese people. Being Korean, a strong work ethic has been instilled in me and is something that I value very highly. However, now that I have come to college and taken that work ethic to the next level, I have put my mental and physical health on the back burner. I no longer really do things I enjoy on a regular basis and have stopped caring for myself as much. I truly don't even really realize it until watching this film and seeing how I did not compare to those who were truly happy. They live simple lives, and yet are so much more fulfilled than people who are working themselves to death. This film really made me think. It scared me, that's for sure, but it also made me feel good. It scared me because I saw that I wasn't as happy as I could be, which is never easy to admit to yourself, but it made me feel good because it did not overcomplicate happiness. We have to get our priorities straight and put more emphasis on things that are truly important.

After watching this movie, you and I realized the same thing. In such a fast-paced society, I have been used to spending my time and energy on study, shopping and entertainment. I used to think that getting good grades, buying things I like, and going out with friends were the things that made me happy. Now, thinking about it carefully, no matter how beautiful these things are, they are all material. They will only make my world more complex and will not bring me real happiness. After watching this movie, I think I should try to make my life easier by giving up the pursuit of some material things ; then I can get spiritual happiness. Just like you said, love for anything can't make you happy, and only loving yourself well is the most important thing. I should spend more time thinking about what I like, what I need and what I hate. When you exactly know yourself can you become the happiest person in the world.


<br><hr>
I had a very similar reaction to the documentary as you. As cliche as it sounds, I found myself reflecting on my own happiness and realizing that I haven’t been looking in the right places. The concept of materialistic goods not correlating to a higher level of happiness is not new to me, and I was aware of this before this class. However, it’s different just hearing it versus actually seeing it. I often try to remind myself that I should seek happiness internally, and spend more time with my friends and family rather than seeking happiness elsewhere. However, I can’t help but think about the times that I have felt pretty happy, and how that correlates with money. Last summer, I got to go on my dream vacation, and I still think about it to this day. I can’t help but think that if my dad didn’t have the work ethic that he did, I wouldn’t have been able to go on the trip. I was able to vacation with my aunt and her side of the family, which isn't an opportunity that I get a lot of the time. So, I just find it hard to find a line between money and one’s level of happiness. I think it would be naive of everyone to say that it doesn’t alter levels of happiness, because to some extent it does. Also, I know many people that have their basic needs met, but they still have a lot of stress from financial issues. We live in an economically driven world, and I think it would be unrealistic to disregard the role of money in our lives.

Two things to start: Bernie for president. And I want to move to Sweden. I want to spend a year with my kid, and then have my spouse spend a year with my kid. And have that 30-hour workweek. I’ve watched my mother be overworked her entire life, and struggle to decide what time she will allow herself to spend with me as she delegates her vacation days (bringing that work with her most of the time anyways to do in her vacation “free time”). Returning to the discussion of this being a generational issue, and our parent’s generation often overbuying and being more excited about the market than us because we recognize the excessiveness and harm it causes, I can’t help but feel that my mom works so hard in order to ensure we feel we have all of the opportunities of my peers. I hope that when I return the gifts she buys me I am not making her work feel worthless, but rather reinforcing the idea that stuff isn’t what will fill that lonesome void of an over-worked mother and being an only child. 
   <br><br>

“Happy” hones in on the idea that that feeling is just that- an emotion. It’s an abstract, nonphysical concept from which a material correlation may not necessarily be derived. It made me think of the movie “Steve Jobs” which I watched recently as well. At one point Jobs is describing his dream for the computer and says “give a human a computer, its like a bicycle for the mind,” as a way to allude to the power that technology can bring. But throughout the film, his emphasis on education is contrasted with his lack of emotional connections, and it is clear that lacking these feelings is taking away the joy of his professional success. Similarly, this same situation can be witnessed within the classic American Dream. With all the shiny stuff American’s focus on accumulating, we are often left unfulfilled as we lack the nonphysical connections that are rooted in human nature. The distraction of stuff minimizes our attention span and leaves us unable to feel the profound appreciation of life others had before all of this modern day commotion.

So first off side note, Sweden is amazing and definitely worth the trip! I also wanted to acknowledge the comments you made about your mother. I completely agree. My parents have worked so hard to provide for my siblings and they do ti because they want me to be able to succeed and not be held back by what I cant have. I have seen my bad extremely overworked and sometime lifeless. It is hard to see them work so hard but be so empty after the fact. 
   <br><br>
I also found your take of the film interesting. Happiness is a feeling for sure. I feel the problem is that many people correlate happiness with monetary things and not with healthy way to find happiness. It is a basic phrase but money doesn't buy happiness. But the problem is, the way society works now a days, is you need to have money to succeed or make it in life.
   <br><br>
It is frustrating how people are so driven by hat they have or in a similar ideas, what they dont or cant have. We become so distracted by having the latest and greatest things and accumulating more and more. We are so distracted that we dont see the looming dangers and threats that are headed right at us immediately.

There were several main points in this film that I found to be extra valuable. First, people who challenge themselves with demanding physical activity are happier than the average person because this allows them to reach a state called “flow”. Once a person reaches this state, they are simply living in the moment and nothing else really matters. Second, I found the Hedonic treadmill to be pretty fascinating. The Hedonic treadmill is one of the big enemies of happiness. In the U.S., we have multiplied our income by two over the last 50 years yet our levels of happiness are unchanged. The Hedonic treadmill is the idea that humans get used to the level of wealth they own and always want more. Third and lastly, “spiritual emotions” are what make us happy. They bring us to things bigger than ourselves, causing our lives to be more fulfilled. Things we can do to engage these “spiritual emotions” are try new experiences, spend time with those we love, do things that have purpose and meaning, and be grateful for what we do have.

The documentary “Happy” taught me that genuine and true happiness is in our hands. We have the power to choose if we want to be happy or not. Before this film, I was unaware that fifty percent of our happiness is in our genes. This means that we are meant to be happy people because half of our happiness is already given without us having to do anything. Ten percent of happiness comes from our circumstances such as where we live, our income, status, and age. These outside factors are not in our complete control but they only amount to a small percentage of our happiness that it doesn’t make sense to why people value these factors above all else. 
   <br><br>
We are currently pursuing happiness through wealth in numbers. There is a misconception in the United States that money buys happiness. The hedonic adaptation is a very dangerous concept that states how adapting to wealth and material goods makes individuals want more and more. Sadly, this is the reality for people all over the world. This notion is only true for those who are really poor in other words, money makes you happy only when basic needs are met. 
   <br><br>
I really enjoyed how this film compared and contrasted the happiest country to the least happy one. Japan as the least happy of the developed countries values economic growth and material prosperity above all else. Most of Japan’s citizens literally work themselves to death in hopes of obtaining happiness through money, image, and status. In contrast, the people of Denmark, the happiest country, are heavily involved in social interaction and cooperation among themselves. These people have the desire to help their community and want to build strong relationships.
   <br><br>
The film summarizes some of the key things we ought to do in order to be happy such include; acts of kindness, being grateful, serving others, being compassionate, and taking part in new experiences. All of the items stated contribute to forty percent of our happiness for which they are intentional activities that we choose to partake in.

I agree this film taught me a lot about happiness too! It made me appreciate everything I currently have and want to live as happy as I possibly can. I feel like the film was able to make so many great point because of how they contrasted lives. The opening scene had me intrigued as the man said he felt like the richest man when he saw his son after his work. I think that it is really beautiful how some people really appreciate life and everything it has to offer. As someone who did not grow up with much and had parents that grew up with a lot less I can see how its the people and the little things that bring you the most happiness. I hope to remember the message this film gave so that I can remember that happiness comes from within. Being kinder is just a great way to spread the happiness too!

I agree that money does not buy happiness, but I do think it helps happiness. I think it is a bit naive to say that happiness is up to us, because people in different situations do not have the ability to reach the same level of happiness. Just like how people born into wealthier families typically have a greater opportunity to succeed, I think they also have a greater opportunity to be happy. With both cases, it's up to the person to take advantage of it or not so we do have some control, but not nearly as much control as I think people often say. 
   <br><br>

I find happiness when I get to see my family. Given we live in different states, the only way I can see them is when one of us spends money to travel to the other. I find happiness knowing the people I love are healthy. The only way that was possible for my aunt was her getting a kidney transplant, and because they had the money, not having to choose between hospital bills or dinner like many others do. I am in no way saying that money buys happiness in the sense of materialistic things. Once the initial excitement is gone, the new car and watch are not going to fill the hole in your heart you were trying to fill through retail therapy. However, in the cases of nonmaterialistic things, like paying airfare or medical bills, money does buy happiness, or at least helps with it. 
   <br><br>

I think again I want to stress that money just gives you the opportunity to be happier. It is what you do with the money that really decides your happiness. People without much money can also be the happiest on the planet, but just generally speaking, I think it is easier to be happy if you have the money to do what makes you happy, because a lot of nonmaterialistic things that make people happy cost money, which is not a bad thing to admit. Materialism doesn't buy happiness, but in a sense, I think money can (just in different ways).

<br><hr>
 I really like the way you explained how money can in some way buy happiness. I did not really think of it in that way. It is true that having enough money to travel to see family and cover health expenses are greta benefits money can be used for.

The film "Happy" was definitely not a film about the environment, but I still appreciated it. I remember the film had just started and it began with a man that had little to nothing, and yet was found to as happy as the average American. That fact was honestly astonishing because the average American has a roof over their head, eats 3 decent meals a day, things like that. In the film, this man barely achieved that and in addition was abused at work, struggled to find filling meals for his family, and yet managed to smile every single day. That is something I find really inspiring because I know that it's easy to fall into the bubble of wanting designer things and needing to keep up with the latest trends, and for me it's very easy to make those things consume your everyday thoughts. However, to see someone with literally nothing and barely a roof over her head literally have the equivalent happiness of someone in the United States is inspiring and made me want to sit back and reevaluate my priorities. Another thing I found really cool was the idea of co-housing in Denmark. This woman had 3 kids and really couldn't afford any of the flats, or else she would be working herself to death, moved into one of the co-houses and instantly her way of living improved. Here, all these families shared chores and tasks, including cooking. I think these type of communities are a reason why Denmark has one of the highest rates of happiness in the world. This was a stark contrast to Japan, and how they literally have something called "Karoshi" where essentially these people are working themselves to death in order to support themselves and their families. For me that was really heartbreaking because it shouldn't be that way, where children are losing their parents, and wives and husbands are losing theorist significant others simply because they are trying to provide.

This video indeed makes me happy. I initially got heartbroken by what I have saw in India, when the man who is taking charging of the rideshaw said that “my home is good”. It makes me ponder upon what is true happiness and how we should value what we have obtained at present, in terms of housing facilities, education opportunities, families and friends. Happiness is easy to derive and pursued as demonstrated in the film: nature makes people happy, friends make people happy, doing sports make people happy. One statement that is both mentioned in the film and in Ken’s video is the conflict of wealth vs happiness. Relating to the topic of greenhouse gas emission, even the wealthiest countries producing most greenhouse gas emissions are not as happy as regions where greenhouse emission is cut off in half. As far as I’m concerned, a country’s development should take its the degree of happiness among its citizens into consideration. Happiness won’t ensure a high standard of living, but it gives people motivation to pursue their dreams and desires.

I think there is a threshold at which stuff and money no longer makes you happy. Money does buy happiness, but to an extent. Once your basic needs are met, your happiness is going to come from meaningful work, relationships, and keeping your time occupied with stuff that brings you joy. Yes, you still need to make money to be a base level of comfortable, but you don't need to be a millionaire to be happy. This film helped to add a sense of perspective to people's lives. The next time you are upset or sad over something take a step back and realize how fortunate you are to be in the position in your life that you are.

It was interesting to hear a film talk about how society’s definition of happiness is very detrimental to the environment but showing ways to be happy without being materialist. I was very surprised to hear that the average American had the same level of happiness as someone below the poverty line in third world countries. It was interesting to hear how after you have your basic needs it is difficult to have things that will bring you more joy after that. This film shows such a range of people and their happiness. Japan is the least happy industrialized country since the country just focuses on working hard, while Denmark is the happiest country with not having to worry about money as much as the United States due to free healthcare and education.
   <br><br>

Dopamine is the chemical in our brain that pretty much makes us feel happiness. However, we can get more dopamine from doing other things such as sports rather than being materialistic. This film shows that there are two routes people can take to achieve happiness, one being effective while the other isn’t. They show what it looks like to go the superficial life but how fruitful it is to focus on personal growth and healthy relationships with those around you. 
   <br><br>

I did not know that your happiness was so linked to genes, with 50% of our capability for happiness for happiness is genetic. It is so sad how many of us focus on our income bringing us joy when it only factors into 10% of our capability for happiness. This gives me more perspective on happiness since there are people who can may never be “happy” despite great circumstances. Overall this film was enjoyable and I liked how we watched a film that isn’t related to the environment for once.

We are literally born with happiness; 50% of our genes contribute to our ability to be happy and contribute to our happiness which I, like you, didn’t know about either! We are born with a positive emotion taking half of our genetics. Even with 50%, it is up to us to decide how to be happy on our own by finding certain hobbies or activities. It is very discouraging to experience and recognizes that sometimes we as Americans can look for “happiness” in the wrong things because we have so much. When the film opened with the Indian rickshaw man admitting that he is “happy”, I could not bring myself to imagine what his life must be like; he did not look “buff” or strong enough to pull a huge cart with people riding it and the roads were not concrete, it was muddy dirt roads. He and his family did not complain about their house especially when it rains. 
    <br><br>

Hearing about different countries in the film was very interesting to me. After experiencing several bombs in WWII, Japan quickly revived their brokenness with a thriving economy and found success within their culture (food, entertainment, architecture) branching around the world. However, even with this revival, Japan still faces brokenness as the “least happy industrialized country” and they even have a whole forest for suicide. As seen with Japan, happiness cannot be bought or created for all to have. 
   <br><br>

The film confirmed to its audience that happiness is subjective and how it is achieved differs among others. I agree with your statement that happiness does not have only two ways to be achieved. Some can find happiness through being alone, listening to music, reading, or hanging out with friends. Everyone has their own definition of happiness. Having a lavish material lifestyle does not equal happiness and stability as seen through the facts and numbers that people below the poverty line with nothing are just as happy as average Americans who have a lot more than most people in other countries. I also enjoyed this movie and appreciated that Ken assigned a film that did not have an environmental agenda as its foundation.

I think the connection between happiness and greenhouse gas emissions was really interesting. Through watching the film, “Happy,” it really underscored the idea of consumer culture in America. The film showed different parts of the world, and how even though they are living what we would consider a lower standard of living, they seem to be much happier. Thus, it further proves the point that we do not need to live in extremely large houses or buy unnecessary stuff. One part of the film I found fascinating was intrinsic and extrinsic goals, which really underscore the value of extrinsic goals in America. Hiltner’s discussion on Sweden's working situation was so shocking to me. As a student interested in public accounting, I was so shocked at the lack of work hours per week. Although bigger companies offer more compensation and benefits, it does not nearly match the paid vacation days and paternity leave that Sweden companies offer. It reminded me of karoshi mentioned in the film about Japanese people and their toxic work relationship. Overall, I think not only did I gain more insight about the disparity between the climate and our idea of happiness, but I also gained knowledge for myself about how to become more happy. I’m really interested in the idea of flow, and how it can make you happier! I didn’t know that aerobic exercise can release dopamine! I may or may not hit the gym next quarter.

At first this film was throwing me off in terms of how it related to this course. The various stories seemed scattered to me at first. After the first 20 minutes I was extremely surprised by the stories shared in the film, and immediately intrigued after. I found many of the claims and ideas expressed in the film confusing at first because happiness has 2 perspectives and is difficult to define. I think this film summed it up very well and helped me come to the conclusion of how happiness does not have a definite answer. I was able to identify the major connection between happiness and consumerism. We are definitely destroying our planet by continuously buying and buying and buying more items. Although we are knowingly doing so, it is saddening to know that it won't stop anytime soon. I found it refreshing to see how the people felt refreshed when they changed their lifestyles. This film actually shows how you could be happy when you have less or have drastic changes in your life. I agree with the statements made about how you sometimes have to go through the rough times to see and feel happy after. Overall, I do agree that we are destroying our pursuit as we try to reach happiness. With Black Friday deals alone, consumerism is consuming millions of people. As people continue to accumulate more and more, trying to convince themselves it'll make them happy, they will realize that these materialistic things actually do not bring happiness. This shows how we are unknowingly destroying our planet in search of happiness in the wrong places. Happiness can be found without the consumer goods, yet we are convincing ourselves that it will make us happy.

I agree with you in that "Happy" really showed how prevalent in society our consumer culture is. In our current culture, happiness is tied to materialism. I think that we've all been there before-we all get a rush when we buy something online. The browsing, the purchase, and the anticipation of the package coming are what's making a lot of people today "happy." I can't say that I haven't had that feeling before. Retailers such as Amazon make it too easy for us to just impulse buy something just because. Being happy does not require having fancy cars and large houses. Happiness comes from within. As long as we love what we do and surround ourselves with people that we care about, happiness just comes naturally.

Coming from a low-income family with 4 other siblings, I didn't have much growing up. My parents are immigrants and came here for refugees. They built the best life they could and tried to support my siblings and I best as they could. And I had the best childhood. They didn't give us much because they couldn't afford to but our childhood together and even now as I transition into my adult life. I am pretty damn happy. After watching the film "Happy," I realize that some people live the way want by choice and some live because that's the only way they can live - no matter which choice it is, if you're happy with your life in the end, then it doesn't matter. 
   <br><br>


This corresponds to Ken's video and how the top 5 happiest countries total CO2 emissions aren't even half of U.S. emissions. I know that throughout this course we constantly emphasize cultural change and how we need to stop buying, eating meat, etc. but the fact that we create so many emissions and are one of the wealthiest countries yet we rank 19 on happiness is so ironic. Money really doesn't buy happiness. Those living in happy countries don't even emit what we do and they love their life. 
   <br><br>


I also liked how the film talked about cohousing - a supportive community is the best thing to grow up in. I feel that you can have a supportive community no matter how wealthy or unwealthy the country you live is in. For example, the man in India said the home he lives in right now with his family is good, he had no complaints. Cohousing might not be ideal for most people, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

I think this was the perfect film to end the quarter. So often do we get caught up in our busy and stressful lives that we don’t even take the time to try to be happy, to try to do something that makes us happy everyday. I immediately thought of the phrase in the constitution, declaring the right to “the pursuit of happiness” (and Kid Cudi’s song). Besides the constitution's flaws, it remains one of the best written and most important documents of all time, and this phrase has always been my favorite. I like to think that everyone has the right to happiness, and it is a bit ironic that we have this phrase in our constitution, yet we are 19th in the world when it comes to happiness. We have this entire ideology centered around the American Dream, which should be true happiness. Yet, by trying to achieve the American Dream, people often grow sad and even depressed. 
   <br><br>

I loved when the Indian man said that once he arrives home and his son runs up to him he feels that he is “not poor, but the richest people on earth.” This just reminded me of my mom who grew up in a poor rancho in Mexico, and how she had such a happy and fun childhood, even though her family had nothing. She always tells me how when she was young she didn’t even think much of being poor or rich, she had her family and friends and she was happy. Something that gave me hope though was hearing how people do good when things go bad, and how one of the key ingredients of happiness is being able to recover from adversity. All of the facts and the science behind happiness is also extremely interesting, like the setpoint, the research and correlations with dopamine levels.  
   <br><br>

It makes complete sense the climate crisis is tied into happiness. It’s no surprise the 5 countries with the happiest people have emissions that are half of those the US produces. We will definitely be happier with a smaller carbon footprint, and with the knowledge that we saved our planet.

Who would’ve thought personal happiness is linked to climate change? Not me. I completely agree with your take on the timing and importance of this film. Society has insisted for us to go after the wrong things in order to acquire happiness, and this largely is a consequence of capitalism. The American Dream is built on this false declaration; materialistic pursuits of happiness are often detrimental to our environment. 
   <br><br>


The inspiring interviews of various happy people, which follow contentedness in multiple lifestyles. I really enjoyed watching how different people’s lifestyles and hobbies have shaped their lives for the better. This conveys how happiness is not defined by our economic success or social status, but by the perspectives of our own situations. The account of your mom’s childhood further confirms that adversity in life does not equate to less happiness.
   <br><br>


I really resonated with the section of the film following generosity. Giving kindness to get happiness is something I strive to achieve each and every day. If everyone pushed themselves to think bigger than yourself, and to explore the benefits of giving up hatred, then our world would be a drastically better place. Especially if more people bring this selfless mindset when it comes to the climate crisis. It’s scientifically proven, doing difficult tasks for the sake of fulfillment and pursuing something you’re passionate about will increase one’s happiness on a physiological level.

I agree, I think this film was a great way to close the class. Like you I think this movie made me reflect on the class as a whole rather than a specific topic. My personal favorite part was seeing people's lifestyles around the world and that definitely made me reflect on my own life here in the United States. I think it's so important to reappraise our day to day problems because so often we attribute so much stress to things that we don't care about a month later. It also made me reflect about the way our society views consumerism, we attribute success with the size of our house and the brand of the car we drive. Everyone has to buy the newest iphone, if we are to limit our fossil fuel output, we need to address the way we think, we should buy products that will work for a long time and fix them when they break rather than buying the newest dress as soon as a celebrity posts it on their social media page. Happiness should be the measure of a successful life, because at the end of the day, isn't that what we are all striving for?

Similarly to the last film, "Happy" is made with the intent to make you think. This film reiterated the message about true happiness: not from what you want, but what you have. While watching this film, I did some introspection and thought about times when I was guilty of this egocentric type of pleasure. As I have gotten older, I believe I have come to appreciate more meaningful things, but I do find myself occasionally desiring something totally unnecessary. It is extremely saddening to see the effect these desires have had on our planet. It is even worse that the more new gadgets and products come out, the less happy people are getting. While I did not know that prior to watching this film, I see how it totally makes sense. Hopefully we can realize the mistakes in our ways before it becomes too late.

I like how you mentioned that true happiness is not from the things you want but from the things you already have. The film “Happy” takes a deep dive into both developed and underdeveloped communities to define what happiness is all about. In the film, the less developed towns and communities were happy despite their circumstances. I distinctly remember one of the fathers saying “some nights we eat without rice and salt, but we are still happy”. This really hit close to home for me. My grandmother grew up in a dusty ranch in Mexico with her 12 brothers and 2 sisters. They all shared one room, one bed, one blanket, no shoes, and sometimes would go nights without eating. Despite this situation, my grandma always tells me yes it was hard, but at the end of the day they were always happy. She remembers all the memories with her brothers and watching them grow up happy since she was the oldest out of all of them. This really makes me think about the way I value my life and how I measure my happiness. 
   <br><br>

I agree with you that as I’ve gotten older, I do appreciate my things way more but I cant seem to get rid of this need to want more. This goes hand in hand with what Ken said about having a misguided pursuit of happiness. We’ve been taught our whole lives that we need to acquire more over the years and that will make us happy. It boggles my mind how in Sweden they have 30 hour work weeks and have universal health care where here in the United States we are breaking our backs at a minimum wage job that doesn’t even cover the cost of health insurance. I really think we need to reevaluate what really makes us happy because the way we measure happiness right now is coming at the cost of destroying the planet.

I thought it was pretty ironic that a country like Costa Rica was so much happier than the United States, even though people in the United States are 13 times wealthier. I guess it really is true that money does not buy happiness. I think the reason, or at least part of the reason we are not as happy is the same for why our carbon emissions are so high - we have a culture in the United Staes that is based off of consumerism. People are told that what they do not have is always better than what they do have. We will never have the best item available because if we do, another better item will soon be advertised and we will be unhappy because we don't have the best again. This of course also leads to high carbon emissions, as new items keep getting produced, which contributes greatly to our carbon footprint. If we keep wanting new stuff, companies will keep making them, and carbon will continue to be released into the atmosphere. I personally am a victim of this consumer culture, as I often like to buy new things that I think will be useful. However, I do try to make the things I buy last as long as possible, which hopefully makes a difference, but obviously not buying it in the first place would be much better. I believe that the solution to making ourselves happier while also reducing our carbon footprint is to learn to be satisfied with what we have, and create a culture that promotes this attitude.

When the film started, I thought that it would have something to do with the climate crisis. I didn’t think the whole point of the movie was showing the different ways people are happy. I found this film to be very interesting and I was even moved by some scenes. A lot of these people are happy just by the simple pleasures in life. This includes being surrounded by their family and friends. Many people around the world, who do not make a lot of money and don’t have a lot in terms of materialistic items, are happier than the average American who makes double or more than them in terms of income. Many Americans focus on making lots of money and having the nicest things. We never stop and focus on what will actually make us happy. 
	   <br><br>
I was moved when the scene from a family in Japan details how a father died from being at work. People work long and hard to earn money. The father/husband was always exhausted; sometimes too exhausted to play with his three year old daughter. He was being overworked and this did not make him happy. This movie made me realize that I have to start paying attention to what makes me happy. It should be experiences with my family and friends, not a new pair of shoes. I, sadly, confuse happiness with purchasing materialistic items, which is horrible for the climate crisis. Our entire lives we are taught that we have to work really hard to get a good job so we can have a good income and buy whatever makes us happy. When does it end though? At what point are we satisfied with the things we purchase? Does having more money truly make us happier? As much as many people want to say that money doesn’t buy happiness, our society has ingrained in us that we will never be happy until we have the best of everything.

I agree with everything you said, especially with the fact that working hard and having materialistic things does not equate to happiness. Going back to the scene with the Japanese family, Japan is one of the few countries in the world whose population is declining, while the human race as a whole is steadily growing larger. This is because people there are unhappy due to their cruel work-culture, and many choose to either move to a different country, drop out of the system, or unfortunately kill themselves. That being said, Japan is not a third-world country-- its one of the most modernized places in the world. This clearly showcases that happiness is not directly correlated to happiness. If time for family and friends was more prioritized in Japanese culture, prioritizing national happiness over GDP, they would be a lot happier as a whole. 
	   <br><br>
Studies have also shown that despite being the most technologically advanced generation and having the highest standard of living, American teens are as a whole less happy than any other previous generation. While Amazon and Google lets us have anything we want in a way that was never previously possible, our current youth are more depressed than ever. We need to stop and think about the things that actually make us happy.

I think we really need to give some deep consideration about the climate crisis and over-consumption, because they are highly related and hard to change as people still keep the bad purchase habit. I would like to image the picture that people can find their own happiness and try to not damage the environment at the same time. That is related to the thing that largely talking about in the video – carbon emission. From the video, the carbon emission seems correlating with the happiness in the happiest country chart. I definitely think that reducing the work time for eliminating carbon emission is a good idea, since it also raises the happiness of workers. If government can consciously spend their money on decreasing the amount of emission as fast as possible, the rank of united states may get up very soon even than my quiz grade.
	   <br><br>

Even though the topic “happy” seems to have no relationship with climate change, getting the way to solve the climate crisis and trying to find the happiness are quite similar from my point of view. By what I mean is that real happiness does not mean buy bunch of useless stuff to make you feel like getting the happiness, but feeling happiness freely from what you really think worthy to do. The materialism gives the emptiness from buying new stuff. It only brings the adverse effect to the whole market which leads the misleading advertisement toward consumers and the cycle is created by people again and again.

This is a mindful video that points to the downside of the human civilization progress. The movie "Happy" is a great documentary that discusses what has been sacrificed for materialism indirectly. This film defines happiness from a greater perspective that I have never noticed. I agree with the film truly that everyone likes happiness, or he/she is on the way to achieve the next stage of happiness. Happiness is ambiguous, but touchable and relatable. It is very important to spread this movie out. If more people understand the behind meaning of happiness by viewing this movie, more people will chase their happiness in a healthier way. i mean healthy towards our planet.
 	   <br><br>

This leads me to flashback to the previous lecture video about communication. I think these documentary movies are ways to communicate and exchange ideas between people. This movie is my favorite movie in this course, and I believe there are many classmates or people in random places who would agree with me. Therefore, if more people watch this film, more people can discover the idea behind happiness. Happiness is more like a lifestyle, and a lifestyle that could make both individuals and our planet "happy" can be a favorable lifestyle that is recommended to a larger population.

One thing that stood out to me after watching the film and Ken’s video on it is that the happiness shown in the film isn’t built on materials and money. Most people seem to think that money buys happiness; it’s shown to me through the video that the statement is not true. Genuine happiness is brought to us by the people around you and the interactions you have with those people. The film’s portrayal of the lives of people in different countries around the world showed me how true happiness is obtained.

I completely agree!  It is not things that make you happy.  Those things are just distractions from true happiness, which is interactions, connecting with people, doing things you enjoy and so much more.  Things simply bring fleeting happiness that never stays and keeps you wanting more.  This is futile and a dead end.  We need to collectively change the American Dream to truly reflect how one pursues happiness.  We need to end our obsession with having things and obtaining more stuff and do what really matters.  With this change will also come reducing our impact on the climate crisis, and this can bring even more meaning and accomplishment into one’s life as they are doing something that is really making a difference in the world.  I see this as a great opportunity for change and improving our lives for the better, while making a difference in the world.

Yes, I too praise the movie showing the audience that happiness come from connection, memories we make with others around us, rather than material things. But this challenge the American Dream, in which we chase happiness with money, power, and status. This is one important point that makes me really look at is the American Dream the ultimate goal? Does it make someone happy for a long time. What is the purpose of life? And a short answer to that question is our impact on others around, our involvement with the community, and finding the right balance of self-growth and communal interactions.

I also like that the movie brought up the two myths: money can't buy happiness and money can buy happiness. It's actually somewhere between, that you need money to satisfy basic needs like food, water, and shelter, money above a certain amount won't make you happy. This clears up the misconception.


<br><hr>
I also found it refreshing that the idea of happiness shown in the film was different than the one we are used to in life. All of us somehow correlate happiness with materialistic things and wealth, even if most of us don't want to admit it. This has to do with the American Dream and how it is engrained in our minds through movies, commercials, and other forms of media. This mentality that wanting more and better stuff isn’t healthy for your mental health, but also it is disastrous for the earth.

Seeing the whole spectrum of how different countries not only rank happiness in their life but what they consider happiness in the film "Happy" was interesting. One thing I found similar within the stories was how strange each lifestyle was to me. I was truly astonished to watch multiple families live in community housing, one big family living in the middle of nowhere where they hunt and grow all their food, and a Japanese family face such tragedy as death due to overworking. Each story included how important the culture or people surrounding you play into how happy you are personally. This made me think of how difficult it can be to adapt to the college lifestyle. Majority of my time now is spent alone working which was hard to adjust to at first as I look back and remember being able to see my friends and family every single day. It is lonely especially when times are tough and you don't have access to those who do bring you happiness but the family I've made here through co-housing has been a special experience. What I got from this film was everyone's version of achieving genuine happiness is different but not everyone can or will achieve it.  America has always played a huge role on this topic with the need for the American Dream or other unrealistic standards. It was shown when talking to people on the street or the rally with the kids on the topic of bullying. It is so ironic because those who were the happiest in the film had the least and didn't care how they looked to the outside world. They seemed to live the richest life when they might be considered "poor" from an outsider perspective.

As much as I approve of the underlying message that Ken is conveying, I don't think that presenting statistics like these really helps convince people to try to live happily instead of grandly. I think one of the worst ways of convincing an American to make a lifestyle change is by comparing them to those in nordic countries. Different populations live with different lifestyles and although those enjoyed by Americans have an environmental tole, copying another countries way of life will push away most people who are actually ok with making a change. I think one of the things that will make people make a change is having that power to make personal changes that matter to them so that they feel like they have their own destiny in their hands. One is most likely to follow through with changes imposed on oneself.
 	   <br><br>
However, as I said I agree with the underlying message that these populations have less of an emphasis on environmentally destructive status symbols such as big cars and big houses. I think that the majority of lifestyle changes will come from within people's own minds as they grow discontent with the life that their existing mindset is helping achieve.

The film, “Happy”, really spoke to me because I believe in what was being discussed. We need significant change in our values and customs. Many people in America don’t have this mindset and believe that money will solve all problems. We constantly work and work to get the newest and the best of everything.  What good are all these things if you have no one to share it with. Like discussed in the documentary, we are inherently social creatures and a supportive community leads to longer, happier lives. My great-grandma is an example of this. She’s 94 years old and she was poor most of her life yet she’s happy and healthy. Most people her age can’t get through the day with a significant amount of help due to their conditions, but other than some hearing issues she’s completely independent. She raised her family the same way she was raised: to value family, to support each other and be grateful for the little we have.  Surrounding yourself with the people you love and who love you really has a much more positive impact than having everything you could ever want.

Damaging the planet is essentially damaging ourselves. Not only from the public health perspective, but also the social and spiritual aspects of us as human beings that we destroy in the process. We have a connection to nature that is broken when we damage the environment for these materialistics values that have been fed to us by large corporations. We are constantly told through advertisements that new shoes or new clothes will make us happy and with all this conditioning, we lose sight of our values and what truly makes us feel happy and whole. I think “Happy” does an excellent job at showing that having the newest or latest whatever doesn’t make you happy. Using material items to make you feel happy is like feeding a black hole, it will never fill and you will never be content with that mindset. Once you have what you need, the rest is excessive and doesn’t make you happier. Essentially doing what you love and being with who you love makes you happy, not what you have or how big your house is.

I thought the film "Happy" was such an important film in the way it highlights how American society truly doesn't value what really matters in its values and customs. I agree that many people don't have the mindset that we need to change our values from monetary to focused on relationships, but rather instead work themselves so much to get the newest and best of everything, but how is any of that material stuff any good if there is no one to share that with? Our most valuables, at least in my opinion, are the relationships and people we surround ourselves with and share our lives and experiences with, the connections we make. In damaging the earth, we are destorying our connection with nature by feeding into these material pleasures that sustain us for far shorter a period than the earth. Essentially, living your life doing what you love and sharing it with who you love should bring you more joy than how many Yeezys you have.

In the documentary “Happy” by Roko Belic, concepts of what it means to be happy in different parts of the world are explored. The exploration of happiness in this film is effective because it illustrates the much simpler ways of living in contrast to the need for constant consumption and profit in America. The film does a great job of discussing how values in America have become twisted in the quest for success and money. Some specific examples in the film that resonated with me was the co-housing situation in Denmark as well as the guarantee of free education through college and free health insurance, the example set by the country of Bhutan, the values in Okinawa, Japan, and the kids who opened up about experiences of bullying at an elementary school. Such examples further convinced me that the only way towards happiness is cultivating loving and respectful relationships with the people around you, and the community at large. Another example that intrigued me was the man pulling a cart being just as happy or even happier than the average American. The constant pursuit of money and profit only tires out the individual and keeps them from truly basking in the happiness of being content with life itself. The film offered much to learn from in terms of letting go of material wealth and building a relationship with the community around you. The greatest joys in life can be found in helping others rather than constantly working to satisfy self-centered needs and wants.

I completely agree with you about the fact that the greatest joys in life consist of things such as deep meaningful relationships and helping others. I too loved seeing all the examples of extreme happiness that people in other countries are experiencing that have nothing to do with their level of American “success” or money. They are deeply happy because they live in community and have rich and meaningful lives. I am deeply disappointed that the American Dream has become one of gaining as much money, success, and fame as you can. These things may make us happy, but only until the point in which our basic needs are met. After that, they only cause more unhappiness because these things often come at the expense of the truly important things in life. The story of all the men that work themselves literally to death in Japan really stuck out to me. I would much rather choose to spend time with the people I love, doing meaningful activities, than slaving away at a job I do not find joy from but makes me a lot of money. I think that a sustainable carbon neutral world would bring immense happiness to every single person on it. People would begin to realize that all this extra material wealth means nothing compared to the joy of having tight knit communities and just slowing down and enjoying the little things in life. Everyone would garden and compost and share all their resources, not because they have to but because they realize how much they have and what they can share because they want to. This world is not one I would ever want to live in, not to mention one I would want my children to live in, and I am hoping one day we can finally realize that there is more to life than money and things.

Happy is an important film because it shows how the American lifestyle of materialism and consumerism doesn’t lead to happiness. The movie shows alternative lifestyles and how they generate their happiness. I completely agree that the false notion of materialism leading to happiness is so dangerous and has led to the unnecessary mass consumerism in our culture which causes climate change and depression. People who are at their peak financial gain and have all they need in the world are still subject to sadness and struggle. Happiness in our culture needs to be highly reconstructed. We need to value happiness on the basis of feelings and the quality of life than on capital gain and things. Obviously having enough money to survive and live a comfortable life is very important, but once you get to that point, you need to focus on what activities or relationships make you the happiest instead of continuously striving for capital gain. We need to focus on activities that put us in the zone and maintain dopamine synapses in the brain such as working out, playing an instrument, or many other activities. I like how the film showed happiness in various styles of life because another important message is that happiness is different for everyone and everyone deserves to find their individual happiness.

After watching the film "Happy," I learned that the United States are so driven by materialistic views and agenda that it has become our essential culture unfortunately. Because Americans are so focused and emphasized on material prosperity we sometimes forget the importance of our surroundings. Thus the environment is going through even more damage than it should be because we are so focused on our own gains. However, the ironic part of all this phenomenon is that people are still not happy enough even though they are gaining many materialistic aspects from their lifestyles. I believe that if we put care and thought into the environment our lives can become happier. If we don't care about our surroundings, then how do we expect our lives to become better when the things around us won't be able to be there anymore for us?

In a nation where materialistic gain drives our daily lives, many people wonder where this cultural flaw came from. Unfortunately, it stems from the very identity of the United States: we are free to use whatever resources we can to make ourselves happy on an individual scale, no strings attached: The American Dream. Over the last three centuries, this mindset has lead to not only the rapid degradation of resources all around the world, but the notion that we must fall in the trap of cyclic consumerism: get money, buy things, be happy, get sad, repeat. It is fortunate that films like "Happy" remind us that true happiness does not lie within materialistic consumption, but rather in the true connection with the people and the world around us. Living by this worldview is extremely beneficial to all of those who choose to undertake it: you get to experience true happiness while also minimizing your overall impact on the planet. Lately, I've tried taking on this perspective myself, and I must say, I feel as if I don't feel the need to spend hundreds of dollars at Guitar Center to be happy anymore. If more people were to apply this mindset to their lives, then I feel like we would all improve our relationships with both each other and the planet.

Throughout the documentary, we have dived into the lives of people in various locations of the world and looked at how their happiness does not stem from materialism or money, but instead things such as physical activities, appreciating what they have, friends and family, etc. One of the stories shared in this documentary was a man who has been surfing for about 40 year, which showed how physical activity can make people happy. It is important to note that dopamine is a chemical in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter that is necessary for feelings of pleasure and happiness. One of the best ways to release dopamine is by doing some form of physical activity, especially when that person is “in the zone.” When this man surfs, he’s happy because he feels in control, forgets his problems, and in a way he kind of forgets himself as well. It’s important to release dopamine because dopamine neurons are the kind where you could possibly lose it if you don’t use it. Not to mention the odds are already stacked against you as you age, since as people age from their teenage years onward, they slowly lose dopamine synapses and probably dopamine neurons as well. Thus, anything that might help them release their dopamine, such as physical activity, is important for a person’s happiness. Another story mentioned in this documentary was a woman who used to be defined as “beautiful” by society and is now not considered “beautiful” by society after she got run over by a truck. She was on the road in an argument with her sister in law, when her hand got caught on the door as her sister in law drove away. She fell and was not able to get back up and was dragged against gravel and rock. When her son and husband (at the time) found her, they thought she was dead. After this incident, she learned to appreciate the things she has, such as the fact that she is alive. It was shifting her focus from her terrible accident to what she is appreciative in life that truly brought her happiness in life. Another story shared in this documentary was about families living in cohousing situations in Denmark contributed to their happiness. In fact, Denmark ranks as the happiest country on Earth. Citizens of Denmark have social equality, high standards of living, free education for college, and free healthcare for life. Particularly in this documentary, we followed a specific co housing community that contains about 20 families within it. We are shown how living in a co housing community can decrease people’s stress levels daily. For example, instead of having to cook every night for dinner for you and your family, you only have to cook about twice a month for the community, meaning when you get home from work you can spend time with your kids and take a shower and just overall unwind from the day. The people who live within this community become a second family to you or a set of extra friends. Living in a community can switch our mentality of what don’t I have to what do I have that I can share. This situation has revealed how being close to family and friends can make you happy. In addition to this story, we saw how having this sense of community in Okinawa, Japan has made the people who live on this island happy. Some traditions they have on the island that keep this sense of community alive is their band of 50 people that contain players from ages 20 to 30 and the elder women having brunch with each other. 
   	   <br><br>
  Unfortunately, not all of Japan is as happy as Okinawa, in fact it is quite the opposite. Japan is the least happy of the wealthy industrialized nations. It is extremely clear that their unhappiness is because of their constant focus on the idea of more money, however focusing more on money and status tend to lead to more dissatisfaction. You see, after WWII, Japan had to build from the ground up and were emphasizing economic growth. Therefore, money became the main thing that drove people in life, it was taught to this this is the way things had to be. However, people are overworking to make money to the point where they are working themselves to death. These situations of people working themselves to death is so common in Japan that they even have a name for it, Karoshi. Imagine losing a parent at a young age all because they worked too much, they were just doing what they have been taught, it’s truly devastating.
    	   <br><br>
 Ed Diener has done research on happiness and it’s interesting that there’s a breakdown of what and how much of what contributes to our happiness. Diener explains how 50% of the difference in our happiness levels are determined by our genes, which they call our genetic set point or genetic set range. Sonja Lyubomirsky explains how most of us are born with a certain range of happiness that we fall in most of the time and even when really good or really bad things happen to us we kind of tend to return to our set point. As for circumstances (income, social status, where you live, etc), this only accounts for 10% of our happiness. When it comes to intentional activity, actions we choose to do, this accounts for 40% of our happiness. I found it quite interesting how if a person wants to become happy it’s important for them to not adapt to what they’re doing, so they would consciously vary what they do. An example of implementing this in their daily life would be to take a different path for a run in the morning. The truth of the matter is you do need some money to be happy, but you don’t need a grand amount to make you happy. Essentially, when you have basic needs met, more money doesn’t seem to buy happiness. Once our basic needs are met, we should no longer rely on money for our happiness, but instead play, have new experiences, be close with friends and family, do things that are meaningful, and appreciate what we have.

The film was very touching and very relatable. It distinguishes that happiness shouldn’t be based on materialistic things and the amount of hours you work. You should be happy based on wherever you stand in life. It was interesting how the highest rank countries have low effect on the gas emissions as the United States who have a greater involvement in  the amount of gas emission released. This distinguishes also how Sweden works less hours than the average AMerican does and still be able to have a  happy and successful life. I agree even though there’s problems everywhere,  we should really reflect on reducing the gas emission and have similar actions to Sweden.In addition, it really is encouraging to hear how other countries with the lowest amount of work hours and less gas emissions produced can still be successful and happy. I noticed how a lot of people work so many hours and yet I never see them have a smile on their face. I also witnessed one of my friends who has a parent that works in the medical field that hardly interacts and engages with their parents since they are always focused on their occupation and not much on their children. I feel that there should be a balance with everything that you do.

Reply: Ruby Campbell: I agree with many of the points you’ve brought up in regard to the American dream and the cultural shift that’s necessary. With the rise of the idea of the American and supporting ideals, the goal of attaining has had detrimental effects on those in pursuit of it. Most notably known as individuals from any social or economic standing who have the ability to work upward to achieve success. Common qualities tacked onto this ‘dream,’ often include financial independence, homeownership, ‘bigger’ (often as better,) and more so independence. With regard to the film we watched, these ideals were tossed aside in favor of smaller housing, smaller as optimal and co-dependence. Too often we are motivated by extrinsic goals which prioritize and have become reflections of ‘attaining’ the American Dream. What is wrong with this continuous chase and attain cycle, is that it’s something that is ever evolving. Therefore calling into question if is ‘something’ that can really be attained. In my eyes, while a great ideal to chase after in some regards, it’s something that yes, has to be different for anyone, to give anyone a chance at reaching it. Further, ideas of ‘what’ success is have been affected by the image supported by both the print and publishing world, and that of other online medias. Often presented are physically attainable goods or services seeking to capitalize on the wish to be happy. As addressed through this film, these are nowhere near necessary in finding personal fulfillment. Addressed within the film are others practicing fulfilling exercises in their daily lives, which translate to their own happiness, with the addition that they attribute less to the global climate footprint. I feel that in addressing the American Dream and the commonly tacked ideals, we as individuals can begin to explore our own happiness, and as a result evolve such a definition as in what it means to achieve ‘success’ and be happy.

I liked how the film “Happy” was different than most films that we have seen in the past, it talks about the psychological side of feeling “happy”. I found the whole movie interesting I feel like it was engaging, and I wanted to keep watching it. As we get older, we start to lose dopamine which is connected with the feeling of happiness. There is always the debate of “does money buy happiness.” Personally, I do think that money buys happiness it gives a sense of relief/security. I have been working since I was 16 and the only reason why I was working was because money was an issue in my household. I feel that much of my high school years I was tired and drained specifically because of work. I wasn’t able to go out with my friends a lot of the time because I was a closing shift lead, so I had a big responsibility at such a young age. Anyone who says that money does not buy happiness is probably financially stable and more than likely well off. There are people in Japan who are killing themselves due to work, it is something common that they even gave it a name “Koroshi”. I understand how this can happen because as human beings we always want to better ourselves and most of the time that means being materialistic unfortunately. I do not think that it is our fault as humans to try and be better, but the pressure we are given by our employers we are always expected more and more we are not machines we are humans, we cannot overwork ourselves.

I can greatly resonate with you. I also really love how this film is being included in this course. It provided a very novel perspective that focuses on the emotional health and psychological well being of us humans. I, too, believe that money cannot buy happiness. At the beginning of the film, my eyes almost tear up when the poor Indian man smiled and said that every time he saw his son sitting at tea shop and called him “baba,” he felt that he is not poor; instead, he is the richest person in the world because he owns his own happiness. I feel absolutely blessed to be born in a family with relatively good financial status to support my life. However, emotional health and psychological well being are always something that haunts me, even to this day. I know that there is so much going on in my life that forbids me from truly owning that feeling of happiness, but after watching this film, I came to a deep realization that everything is possible. There is one man in the film, sitting on his boat comfortably and said that nature is good medicine. Now I realize that nature is not good medicine, I am the most crucial medicine to myself.


<br><hr>
I definitely second your comment post. Similarly, I found the whole film interesting and in fact, engaging because it makes you reflect on who you are and how are you living your life. Money is seen as a hamster wheel, they are constantly in the 'work' mode pursuing money, not realizing that it will never satisfy their desires. People are more concerned about profit,  more buildings, more sales, more of this and that, but not enough signs of showing love or human connection to themselves and to the environment around them. As the film explains, happiness could never be measured by how much money you have. People around the world are dying of force and underpaid labor just so they could earn wages that will fulfill their family's stomach and needs, without realizing that money is eating their time to spend with their family and live an authentic life by showing love and human connection.

I really like this film. It invokes me to wonder why we are always satisfied with those small things, even if we don’t really need them. Consuming can just bring us temporary happiness but leaves us with a massive wound that we need to fill it up. I consider the film really impactful because it gives me the awareness that I need to do or at least aspire for a better lifestyle. That is all I need to do. I agree with the idea of cohousing because it is cohousing that brings people together, to break the distance between people. This film focuses on the real happiness, and the key is to take control of our own life.

The film "Happy" discussed how when somebody has their fundamental needs met like nourishment, garments, and sanctuary, their degree of joy remains steady. This implies individuals are purchasing more so as to attempt to become more happy when it isn't helping in any way. This week's talk video was an incredible end to the course, and Ken worked superbly outlining the principle subjects of the course into one video. Ken recorded ten individual activities just as ten group and political activities. The individual activities tended to numerous subjects, for example, lessening nourishment squander, eating a more plant based eating routine, open transportation, and adopting on an increasingly moderate strategy to an every day way of life. The qualification that Ken makes between veganism/freganism and climatarianism is significant. Individuals can settle on nourishment decisions that take in thought the earth. 
       	   <br><br>
    I don't imagine that it is our issue as people to attempt to be better, however the weight we are given by our bosses we are constantly expected increasingly more we are not machines we are people, we can't exhaust ourselves. 
   	   <br><br>
With more cash comes the attitude that you could purchase anything, bringing about a great deal of unused things left in a capacity box. 
   	   <br><br>
This equivalents an expansion in carbon outflow and this isn't useful for the environment. I like how Ken consistently makes reference to the Kardashians on the grounds that they have such a lot of cash and they truly spend it on superfluous things. I appreciated this video because it really put my point of view into perspective.

I agree with you here. After watching the film "Happy", I felt like I had a different understanding of what happiness can mean to someone. Are people really happier when they can buy more stuff and live more lavishly? The common answer would be yes. This is partly due to how American consumerism has tricked people into thinking that the American dream ( big cars, big houses, big spending ) is the ultimate goal for people. Especially when people have been driven to do work in order to reach this dream, it becomes hard for them to rethink their idea of what happiness means to them, or what they think would bring them happiness. They can easily think, "If I worked hard for this kind of lifestyle, why should I change it". This is very apparent in 1st generation individuals; they moved to the US in order to make it big.  Films like these can help people from moving away from this idea.

While I agree that their is an overarching correlation between happiness and greenhouse gas emissions, I strongly disagree with the premise of this video. This is a CORRELATION not causation. There are several other factors that correlate with higher greenhouse gas emissions such as cultural values, sociological hierarchy organization, and economic organization. It is true that in order to address greenhouse gas emmisions, all other aspects of life in any given country would also have to change. For example, the green new deal has shown us that in order to acheive zero emissions we would have to completely restructure our economy (which would also greatly impact distribution of wealth and likely the sociological hierarchy) and cultural values. My argument is not that the above statements are not true. My problem with this film and specifically Kens statement that "greenhouse gas emissions soar as a result of our pursuit of happiness, but our happiness has actually declined;" is that it draws a false conclusion as to what the problem actually is. Whats worse is that Ken states it in such a way that we are to believe that this is simply fact, however, his statistical evidence only suggest a correlation NOT causation. There are genuine and fundamental flaws with the american way of life, summing it up to a problem of emissions is ridiculous and misleading. I would argue instead that our copious emissions and correlated unhappiness are actually both the result of organizational and political struggles, rather than one causing the other. So what does this distinction change about the argument made and the course of action we should take? Virtually nothing, I firmly believe that making adjustments in favor of mitigating climate change will also result in structural changes that overall improve the quality of the american way of life. The point is, even if it changes nothing, we need to be explicit and honest in our arguments when discussing climate change.

In 2017 I was fortunate enough to travel to Zimbabwe to volunteer at a local wildlife orphanage. During my two weeks there, we had very limited WiFi access and ended up only using our phones to email our parents every once in a while. At first I noticed the absence of my phone and was stressed not knowing what was going on with my friends every minute of the day. In a surprisingly short amount of time, however, I completely forgot about my phone and felt an immense sense of peace and contentedness. As cliche at it sounds, I was truly able to live in the moment. I made close connections with the people around me and had an amazing time exploring the country and working with the animals. When the short trip came to an end and I was in the airport, I turned my phone on and opened up social media for the first time in two weeks. I immediately was incredibly anxious. I remember saying to my friend that I wished I could just leave it off for longer. 
       	   <br><br>

I think about this anecdote often, and it makes me realize that all this stuff that we obsess over in this country does not bring us happiness. In reality, it makes us more anxious. The more stuff we have, the more we have to think about, and the less we can appreciate the experiences we could be having in any given moment. I strongly believe the cultural changes that will come along with the climate crisis will make us happier, at least those who are willing to embrace the changes. It is no coincidence that America is far from being one of the happiest countries in the world. There are very few countries who have as unhealthy an obsession with material items as we do. This obsession makes us act with greed and ignore our basic humanity, a sad truth that I believe has caused many of the terrible problems the US has caused. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to make people realize they will be happier without the items they hold onto so dearly. That is a realization that everyone has to come to on their own, and I sincerely hope they do.

I think exploring the concept of happiness is fundamental to our understanding of the climate crisis, the crisis of global capitalism, and human society at large. As mentioned in the film, for the “pursuit of happiness” being one of three guiding principles of our constitution, our system does a pretty horrible job of fostering this pursuit. This is not a simple concept by any means. Many people struggle with mental illnesses for a variety of reasons with many possible factors influencing their struggles to feel happiness—genetic predisposition, traumatic life experiences, brain injuries…the list goes on. However, I think the most universal driver of unhappiness in our species is the fundamental misunderstanding that money can be equated with happiness. As cliché as it seems, and as much as people say that they don’t believe in it anymore, the idea of “buying happiness” is very much prevalent in our dominant paradigm. Whether or not we consciously think we believe in it, there are systematic pressures which make us feel the opposite.

I found the concept of “flow” to be fascinating. As a skateboarder and musician, I have a constant source of theoretically infinite joy at my disposal. It doesn’t matter how many hours I skate or play music, I will never get sick of it…and they are both free activities. I’ve found that a lot of my friends and peers don’t have any sort of genuine hobbies or interests in their lives. In fact, I feel like most Americans don’t. That’s why so many Americans spend their time off from work doing activities that cost them money: drinking alcohol, eating out at restaurants, shopping, movies, concerts, sports games, etc. None of these are inherently bad things—in moderation, they are all great sources of happiness. However, when an individual doesn’t have any hobby that fosters creativity, individuality, and expression, it is hard to be truly happy.

I really enjoyed this week's film. It was extremely different from what we have seen so far, but it was a good different. The film was uplifting and gave a a great deal of hope in the midst of the climate crisis that we have been battling. This documentary gives truth to what Ken said about happiness and money: "Beyond a certain point, money cannot bring you more happiness". We are shown over and over again that some of the happiest people in the world are ones that have faced great adversities. Difficulties that no one should ever have to go through. Most people think that life will be worse if we make the changes needed to combat climate change, but the stories in this film have shown me that we can still have happy lives no matter what we do to modify our lifestyles.

One of the parts that stood out to me the most was when a government official in Bhutan explained that they  are trying to maximize growth national happiness, not gross domestic product. I like this idea because it shows that the government really does care about its people, not just its economy. The only thing that a government should be concerned about is the safety and well-being of all the residents of their country.
       	   <br><br>

I especially enjoyed the fact that all of the stories and people that we were shown, had completely different lives. One person was living on a farm and another was in multi-family housing. There was also a community in Okinawa, and a community in Namibia. It was fascinating to see how they all went about their daily lives. Even though each person's lifestyle was completely separate from the others, they all found happiness in their own way. I hope that one day everyone can see that no matter who you are or where you come from, happiness is for everyone.

I also found the clip featuring Bhutan to be extremely eye-opening, yet its goal makes so much sense. Especially prominent in the US, much of our infrastructure and businesses were established under the false assumption that doing so would help the economy and allow for more prosperous lives. While we cannot ignore the fact that creating opportunities that get people above the poverty line is a priority, reaching for far more than we actually need has the opposite effects on our happiness. Instead of trying to aim for happiness indirectly by turning towards materialism, Bhutan’s government fosters happiness directly from the source. As stated in the video, happier people tend to enjoy their work more and get along with others, and thus be more productive. In the US and countries like Japan, however, we tend to believe that work and happiness work in the opposite direction: by working more, we can buy what we want in order to be happy. Clearly, this mindset has shown to be false. This part of the documentary also ties in some ideas shown in minimalism, where wanting less extrinsic rewards ultimately leads to healthier and happier lives.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. What Bhutan is doing in their country is amazing and more countries should think about changing to their approach. Time and time again we have seen that to an extent, more money cannot buy more happiness. The United States is considered to be one of the richest countries in the world, yet we are most certainly not the happiest. We have a false idea that increasing the money we have as a country will make us a more prosperous one. I agree that opening jobs for people who do not have one is extremely important and cannot be ignored, but at a certain point, there is not need for one person to have billions and billions of dollars. Nobody would be able to spend that much money in one lifetime even if they tried.

To be honest, I’m a person who likes shopping and buying stuff when I feel depressed or encounter some hard times. However, this week’s movie made me reflect upon it. Thinking back to every time after I spent an amount of money on something I don’t really need, did I really feel happy? Or could that happiness last for a long time? The answer is no. I probably could feel satisfied and “happy” in a short time after that, but those positive feelings never last too long. And when I feel stressed again, I would repeat what I did previously to get those feelings back. Then a cycle formed, which is a cycle formed based on consumerism. After watching the movie and Ken’s video, I feel like today’s people really need to rethink what “happy” means to them; living in a big house or driving a fancy car probably is not the best answer for this.

"Happy" was an extremely interesting and encouraging documentary that promoted happiness as an emotion that should not stem from materialism. I wholeheartedly agree with this.
       	   <br><br>
Seeing how happy the rickshaw driver was at the beginning of the film was really heartwarming. Although he has to deal with rough living and weather conditions, he explains that spending time with his children, family members, and other loved ones makes him happy. He also added that he feels "that [he] is not poor, but [he is] the richest person."
       	   <br><br>
I feel that many people have heard about the conception that money cannot buy you happiness. As the documentary argues, this isn't necessarily always true, because you can use money to buy yourself out of poverty. However, once you have your basic needs met, money then cannot be the ultimate method of satisfaction. This can be seen through the Hedonic treadmill, an idea that a person always wants more throughout their lives, and materialism ends up becoming a primary enemy of happiness. 
       	   <br><br>
It was encouraging to see that many countries are working to prioritize the happiness of their citizens rather than the overall GDP. For example, Bhutan is currently in an experiment where they value happiness of their citizens. Denmark also prioritizes happiness as they provide free education benefits and co-housing communities of their people, making Denmark one of the most happiest countries in the world consistently. However, in countries such as Japan, the story becomes different. Many Japanese workers are constantly tired and suffer from fatigue, but they need to keep working to earn money and pursue their materialistic desires; it's unfortunate to see how many workers are dying from Karoshi, which is death from overworking.
       	   <br><br>
Ultimately, "Happy" conveys a strong message towards the climate crisis; the planet is slowly dying because people are pursuing their materialistic desires. it's important to understand that happiness does not come from money or materialism, but rather the mindset to live life to the fullest despite difficult circumstances.

I agree with everything you said Daniel, I also found the film “Happy” you be very intriguing and inspiring.  The fact this film revolves around the fact that material objects do not give humans happiness, in fact a lot of people who have less materialistic things are much happier than the average American who has more than what they need.  This is because in our society there is constantly new products being introduced and naturally we desire all of these cool objects. Our constant need to always have the best and newest things are the reasons why we are not truly happy because we buy something we want and although it brings momentary pleasure it does not last, and we are left sad because we want more things (which continues to cycle). Happiness is not something we can buy; it is something we need to find within ourselves through being the best version of ourselves possible. Doing things like spending time with friends, quality time with your pets, or even a quiet night alone are all things that may make you happy. Money does not equal happiness, if anything in most situations’ money is what leads to unhappiness. It is important to have enough money to sustain yourself, but we do not need a surplus of money to lavish ourselves with. I also loved learning about other countries and their efforts to maximize happiness for their people. I think it is really important to learn how human beings need breaks and we need days off for ourselves to regroup and reenergize ourselves. The conditions in Japan are absolutely disgusting, it is horrible seeing these people literally drop dead because they are being overworked. The things we see happening in Japan is proof that mental health days are real, and they are necessary. Once this becomes an accepted concept here in America the more kids and adults will be happier. All in all, the documentary “Happy” sends an important message about our current climate crisis and how our society here is twisted, and we need to start making changes in order to start making a difference.

I agree! I really liked this film, and it was weird because earlier today before watching this I had the exact same conversation with one of my best friends about happiness.  One of the things that struck out to me the most was the scene about japan, and how the people there are literally working themselves to death.  It saddens me to see this happening in the world, but it also gave me hope to see that some countries are realizing this, like Bhutan, and actually making a conscious effort to stop it.  It's crazy to me how much of America is stuck in the illusion that money buys happiness, and that the key to happiness is also getting more, yet the film showed that the happiest people are often the ones with the least, which ties into the film on minimalism that we also watched in class.  The heaviest scene for me was when the man was speaking to school about bullying, and the two kids volunteered to come up and speak out about the bullying that occurs to them.  I almost started crying when the kid talked about being picked on for being short, because the same thing used to happen to me so that kind of hit deep.  Overall, this film was a nice refresher for the things that I find value in, and how I want to interact with the world.  the most important thing to me is my relationships with people and the world around me, and I think that it can do everyone good to disconnect from social media for a while and focus on pursuing things with actual value, instead of mindless scrolling and comparing your lives to others. 
       	   <br><br>
I think there is a lot of happiness to be found in the world, but I also think that there is a lot of misguided pursuits of happiness to be found as well.  in the end, life is what you make of it, and this film helped me realize the importance of what I put value into.
<br><hr>
Like you expressed, happiness within the film was portrayed to have an extreme relation to the minimalism concept we watched earlier in this course. Even through my own experience and the minimal changes I made after watching the Minimalism film I find myself to appreciate the concept of minimalism and its relationship to happiness. I also found teh rickshaw driver as expretemlly inpsiring. My initial thought while watching him was sadly that his job looked like hell to me. I would hate to have to run people around all day in a cart. I can't even imagine the strain that takes on one's body. However, once I saw his relationship with his kids and family I was able to understand the motivations between his hard work and the naive perspective I had on his life. His claim to being the richest person was extremely heartwarming and functioned as a great portrayal of where happiness can stem from. Our typical definition comes from success and money, but happiness can completely come from others around you which sadly I believe people in our society tend to forget. When I was younger my parents would take my brothers and I to the same park every week for almost three years. The park was not in an amazing area, but my dad always made a point to show us how the people at the park, even though they did not have money, were so incredibly happy. They would have barbeques with large groups of people and music and were always smiling. I really appreciate my dad’s efforts now to show us the importance of people and healthy relationships in one’s happiness. Like Daniel emphasized,  I really agree with the idea that once you have basic needs met you can not be much happier. I used to believe that living in comfort and living in extreme comfort were drastically different, which in part they are, but to an unnecessary level. I fully believe that materialism is the enemy of happiness. If you keep on searching for material items to give you happiness, even unlimited amounts of money will never satisfy you. Countries that value happiness over GDP are in my opinion doing a much better job of caring for their citizens. The pursuit of happiness that we find in the constitution from Jefferson should not be an empty promise but stand for true change in the economic approach that our government has through relations with people. Finally, like Daniel showcases, the search for happiness through material items is not only decreasing the actual chance that we find true happiness but unfortunately destroying our planet simultaneously.

I agree and thought that this film was extremely inspiring and heartwarming. When originally starting this film, I expected it to be a little bit different. I was not expecting it to actually make me tear up and think about my own happiness in my life. This film focuses on living simply to promote a happy life. We have always been told in our society that “money makes us happy” and “the american dream is wealth”. However, this could not be farther from the truth. According to stats America is twice as wealthy as it was 15 years ago and happiness has been stagnant. Happiness has not increased by increasing house sizes or buying more expensive items. Money is only able to change your happiness if it is able to buy you out of burdens (homlessness, starvation, etc). When you already have the basics, you are not able to gain any more happiness, and instead may even decrease your happiness. To gain happiness people need to focus on establishing close relationships with their friends and family. I personally feel happier when I’m able to spend time with my close friends rather than consuming. I found one of the stories in the film really inspiring and definitely made me realize that we are able to choose our own happiness. After being in a terrible accident and going through heartbreak, she was able to bounce back and regain her happiness back. I also found the subject of Denmark very interesting. Denmark is known to be the happiest place due to the simple lives people live. Denmark has provided free healthcare, tuition, and adapted the concept of co housing. Living alone isolates and makes most people depressed (especially people who are divorced). One lady in particular noted that co housing “saved her” because she is a single mom. She would struggle having to raise her children by herself. Overall, I found this film very inspiring and it is definitely going to make me think about the more important aspects of life.
<br><hr>
Happiness is something I have always wondered about. Whenever people ask the question, “what do you want to be in life,” people immediately say, “I want to be happy.” But what does that really mean? The recipe to happiness is different for everyone and this week’s film accurately explains that. Multiple times, I have heard that the richest people are the unhappiest. While money and success are not the secret to happiness, I think that financial stability is the foundation to happiness. As the film said, happiness greatly increases from five thousand to fifty thousand but not fifty thousand to five million. I agree, once you have your basic needs met, money can no longer be the driving factor of happiness.
       	   <br><br>

The Declaration of Independence states that we all have “certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” I think sometimes we forget about how to be happy and what it really means to be happy after we are financially stable. Instead of filling our lives with more relationships, we fill our lives with more and more stuff. Materialism is a major reason why many Americans are unhappy. I fully believe that happier people will lead to a healthier planet. 
       	   <br><br>

To do this, I think the government should help. The points Ken made about countries like Sweden where people have free health care, free college education, 30-hour work weeks, emit a fraction of what Americans do, and are happier is pretty convincing. Many of these promises are guaranteed in the Green New Deal. I think implementing the Green New Deal would be a promising first step towards creating a healthier and happier planet.
<br><hr>

Just as you said, I found it very inspiring that countries like Bhutan are putting the happiness of their citizens above everything else. After learning so much in the past few weeks through this course about targeted marketing in America that works to manipulate American consumers, it was nice to see that there are governments who are focused on more well-meaning goals and serving their citizens instead of just doing anything to make profits. On the flip side of this, is the example of Karoshi in Japan. The concept that people are literally being worked to death just to support their families and lifestyles really hit me hard. It is even more concerning that this seems to be what American society is moving towards due to this constant need to “earn money to pursue materialistic desires” as you said. 

       	   <br><br>



Another aspect that I found encouraging was that some of the top “happiest” countries that Ken mentioned have average carbon footprints that are more than half less of the current average American’s. Additionally, many of these countries, such as Sweden, are western countries that have achieved this goal of reducing carbon emissions while maintaining high standards of living and meaningful happy lives. If we can follow the example set by these countries, we may have a chance of not only helping save the planet but also increasing our overall happiness.

I really enjoyed watching this film and how they  want to teach us that happiness doesn't come from materialistic things but from things we can do on a regular basis to make us happy. They show us that only you can make yourself happy through the changes you make. We are shown different stories about people and their journey to happiness and how none of them included materialistic things like money but compassion. We are shown how the will to overcome adversity like Melissa Mood after her accident did, leads to a happier life. I really enjoyed how the film shows us people who have found out how to be happy or how to become happier and encourage us to seek our own happiness and to let go of the things that don't. 
        	   <br><br>
My reaction to the film was emotional. I have been stuck in this limbo of not knowing what to do with my life because I am not happy no matter what I do. I thought like many people that buying stuff that society says would make me feel happier would but it's not. This film made me realize that I need to have more social bonding and cooperation with others. I have isolated myself and hanging out with others and talking to my family seems like a good way for me to start my pursuit of happiness. Something new I learned from the film is that there is a tribe that is disconnected from the modern world and are so in tune with one another and the Earth and they are happy to be living such simple lives. But while their lives may be simple, they much like Roy Blanchard and his family, have everything they need.

I also, as you stated, really enjoyed this film immensely. We all desire to live a happy and fulfilling life. The film Happy evidently proved that people can not ultimately achieve this goal by only focusing on rewards, praise, money, image, and popularity. Many believe that if they buy the newest clothes or if something good happens to them, the joy will last a long duration of time: In reality, these small victories of feeling of happiness will dissipate shortly. The ability to truly live a happy life comes from the focus on personal growth, relationships, and a desire to help. Money is not the answer that solves humans’ personal problems. Yes. It is important to be able to have enough money to have basic needs; however, past that, what is money good for? 

        	   <br><br>

The human need for consumer goods steers them away from looking at the more fulfilling aspects of life. Which in turn not only hurts the spirit of a person but also is largely impacting the environment. The more products we want, the more products are needed to be produced; which consequently releases more greenhouse gas emissions. We are hurting ourselves and the environment.
        	   <br><br>


 People who choose to live their life minimally with tranquility, are the people who will prosper. In Japan, the approach is to focus on work and the Japanese work themselves to death so often they even have a saying for it. While in Denmark, people are prospering by living communally and not worrying about the largest stress factor, money. There are many small shifts people can do to have a more centered and sound life as including meditation, yoga, or exercise. By realizing what is important and living a life around this priority of focusing on something more important than themselves, they are more likely to achieve true happiness.

I personally really enjoyed watching this film too. I was interested in how they would teach about happiness and define what happiness is and I think they did a great job including a variety of real-world examples on our planet. I think that showing different stories about people and their journey to happiness was effective at conveying the importance of living an intrinsic life. I thought Melissa Mood’s story was amazing because of how she was able to move on from her tragic accident and lead to live a happy life. She admits that it was hard and she thought about ending her own life, but in order to keep living she looked to find things around her that could help her move on and find enjoyment in life again. The film does a great job at encouraging others to be happy and I agree that it taught me to let things go that do not make me happy. I was also very emotional when viewing certain parts of this film. The most heartwarming part of this film was the Okinawa people. To see 100-year-old humans so happy and content with their lives was wholesome and I aspire to be like them when I get older. I found the Japanese part of the movie to be incredibly sad as people are overworked and too focused on working that they become depressed and even die. It is definitely a scary thought to think that in a capitalist society like America, I could easily be engrossed in the culture and mindset that I need to work and make money to lead a happier life. Not to mention the bombardment of advertisements on my phone, laptop, on campus, and in books. The most important lesson I learned from this film is that you do not need wealth or material to lead a happy life. In order to lead a happy life I must prioritize on my relationships, personal growth, and a desire to help others in my community. I can see how this ties to the class about the climate crisis. If we are happy with what we have and are not chasing after material then we are helping to mitigate the climate crisis by buying less stuff. This can be applied to food as many people are obsessed with the quality of their food and are living to eat rather than eating to live. I can apply these tips from the documentary to my own life by being watchful for my mental state and what I am being attracted to on a daily basis.

The film "Happy" talked about how when someone has their basic needs met like food, clothing, and shelter, their level of happiness stays constant. This means that people are buying more in order to try and become happier when, in fact, it is not helping at all. On top of this, people are working harder in order to have more purchasing power, which actually makes them less happy. Another thing that was explained was the hedonic treadmill, which is when you adapt to whatever goods you have and you always want more. This is why even if you get richer and have more things, you are still left unsatisfied. I really liked how the film mentioned that 50% of happiness comes from genes, 40% comes from intentional activity and only 10% comes from job status and income. I think there is definitely a misunderstanding in that sense as to why people are unhappy. My friend always complains about how a girl she knows is depressed despite having everything. I think that this helps explain why that is, on top of the hedonic treadmill. Furthermore, I found it interesting that we all have a genetic set point of happiness. Really bad things can make us very sad at the moment but we actually return to the set point faster than we think. The same is true for really good things. An example that came to me was when I used to play volleyball and we won a game, we would be really happy but after the tournament, it was no longer a big deal. We returned to our set point of happiness.

The last thing that I would like to touch on is the idea of flow that one of the interviewees mentioned. He states that flow is, “...the synergy of different aspects of consciousness where you wish it could go forever because you feel like you are completely fulfilling something that you can do well and that nothing else matters.” I think this idea has a lot to do with the fact that 40% of happiness comes from intentional activity. His example was someone playing an instrument and feeling in control because they know when they get the notes right because they can hear it. Finishing the song makes you feel like you accomplished something and you feel fulfilled. That’s why it's really important to do extracurricular activities or to have hobbies that make you happy. People need to understand that happiness does not come from materialistic values and I think that this would make a big difference in the climate crisis.

It’s sad that some people who chase happiness through material goods have basically been conditioned to. It’s hard to not have a flawed idea of happiness when everything in the media tells us we need a certain thing or look a particular way to be fulfilled. I think being aware of the hedonic treadmill is a good initial step to getting off of it. Because unsustainable ways of seeking happiness have become normalized, we must actively do things that would be in the 40% of the happiness equation. As you said, activities that you get into the state of flow could definitely be helpful. Something that gets me in that zone is doing yoga and meditating. The film also mentioned religion and spirituality as a way for some to believe in something bigger than themselves and yoga/meditation is a way that I practice spirituality.


<br><hr>


Remembering that only 10%  of our happiness comes from circumstances like money and status is really important, especially for people like me, who have grown up in a society which encourages us to make money the focus of our lives. It is really easy to get stuck on the hedonic treadmill. That is, we think happiness is just around the corner if we achieve a certain amount of material success. In the film, it is mentioned that when we achieve our goals, our sense of joy and fulfillment is often short-lived. 

        	   <br><br>

I also get into a sort of flow when I cook or draw or paint. I think it has something to do with giving one task your complete focus. In our internet-centered society, it is easy to forget to take time away from all of the noise and distractions we are constantly surrounded with. Focusing on something you enjoy is how we disengage from the constant influx of information.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. It is interesting that the film’s perspective is on the causes of happiness, not the causes of depression or anything else that we have seen usually. I liked this film because it brings an optimistic way to think about life and seeking happiness. In a pie chart presented in the film, it is surprising to see that only 10 percent of our happiness is based on our circumstances, which include income, social status, where do you live, age, etc., while 40 percent is actually based on our intentional activity, which means what we choose to do. This data strongly encouraged people that you have the power to decide where you can be happy, rather than your material basis or anything, because money can’t buy you happiness, or say it can only buy you temporary happiness, it is not true happiness, true happiness is living with what you are passionate about. The film suggests one way to keep the happy “flowing” is to exercise because this can release dopamine, which makes you happy. I’m not an exercise person but I would like to try to exercise more often after watching the film. Anyways, I think this is a good film to watch and I would recommend it to my friends.

Thank you for replying to my comment. I agree that it is interesting that the film's perspective is on the causes of happiness and not the causes of depression. When I first watched the film, I was likewise surprised that only 10 percent of our happiness is based on our circumstances. In my opinion, though, this is good news. If people are able to better control their happiness with intentional activity, which like you mentioned is 40% of out happiness, then more people, theoretically, should have the ability to be happy. I think it is important to note that once you reach the threshold of making 75,000 dollars a year, that is when it no longer matters how much more money you make; you will be the same level of happy. I also think it's important to exercise because the dopamine truly does make a difference. I remember that when I play volleyball, for example, I am significantly happier for the rest of they day than what I would be normally. I would also recommend this film to my friends. Thanks again!

I really liked seeing how other people lived in ways that made them happier, especially the co-housing community in Denmark. I think it's really important to have a community, people you're able to talk to daily. I play games online with my friends pretty much every day. I also really like that they share responsibilities. Only having to cook dinner at most twice a month sounds like an amazing thing. The fact that they have their own houses also adds to the plusses, so if you don't feel like hanging out with people you can find an isolated/quiet place. The co-housing part of "Happy" ties happiness and saving the environment together. In this class, we have talked about co-housing as an alternative to suburban/rural living, and it just so happens that the people that live in co-housing communities are shown to be happier. Why would we say no to killing two birds with one stone?

It was so sad to watch the Japanese portion of the film, the one that touched on karoshi. Hearing about the father that was so tired, he couldn't even play with his daughter was heartbreaking. It was especially sad that the mother was singing in the choir at the karoshi victims' family event and she started crying. The lyrics of the song were so sad too.

We need to stop focusing on the GDP of our countries and start to focus on the GNH (Gross National Happiness) of our country. By working towards the goals of ending climate change I do think that we can create a happier, safer world.

One of my favorite parts of the college experience so far has been living with or quite close to a bunch of my closest friends. Every quarter, if not every month, we plan barbecues/potlucks and other sorts of gatherings that are always some of the most fun parts of every quarter. Knowing that, I had thought about the happiness aspect when we last talked about co-housing, and I definitely agree with you here. If we can be happier and also reduce our footprint, then I don’t see a good reason not to elevate co-housing communities in the US. More broadly, I can see from the culmination of the material we’ve covered in this class how the “search for stuff” in the US has led to our over-consumption despite a relatively static amount of satisfaction. This just made the discussion of karoshi/overworking in Japan that much more sad as surely the stresses of work for many of those people are in efforts to meet unnecessary supplies for consumption.
        	   <br><br>


On a separate note, one other thing that stood out to me in the film was the discussion of where happiness comes from on a pie chart. 50% is said to be genetic, 40% is from “flow” and similar intrinsic validations as well as social interactions, and only 10% comes from recent events. I actually had a pretty easy time believing that even some of the most upsetting events tend to have short-lived effects on overall happiness. I even observed it first hand as many of my housemates were “devastated” when the 49ers lost the Super Bowl but obviously they virtually forgot about it shortly after.

I think living a good life isn't necessarily dictated by a specific, ideal lifestyle and varies among individuals. Everyone is raised in different circumstances with different habits so everyone will have different methods in reaching that happiness. I think the reason why so many Americans find no satisfaction in consumerism is that they have not found a satisfying way of living that caters to their "pursuit of happiness". Consumerism tricks us into temporary happiness continuously through shopping which is why I believe we are so addicted to its ideals. In a way, consumerism is a drug, it temporarily satisfies a deep craving within ourselves which only lasts until we want more. Certain people even experience withdrawals from stopping such as anxiety and decreased contentment. For so long, the "pursuit of happiness" has been sought out by pursuing the American Dream, but it seems like even having it all does not guarantee a satisfactory lifestyle. As ken points out, Americans have been getting less and less happy, feeling more and more dissatisfied with their belongings.

The film "Happy" is incredibly powerful because its main message is that the true path to happiness is different for every individual and not necessarily attributed to material belongings or affluence. At the end of the day, you are in control of your life so you decide what to make of it. One great point made in the documentary was that belonging to a community is an essential source of happiness for most individuals. With people in countries such as Japan or even in the U.S., that sense of community is not present in the work environment. Everyone is in the industry to provide for themselves and their families. In a community, where kindness and helping others is key, people feel like their actions are fulfilling and vital to the community's survival. In the corporate world, many people feel forced to work jobs they hate in order to keep fueling consumerism because it is such an ingrained illusion of happiness in our minds.

Yes, indeed. The film effectively expresses its main idea by using several scientific resources and various story backgrounds to illustrate. First, it uses authoritative resources that happiness is 50% caused by genetic reasons, 10% by circumstances, and 40% intentional behaviors which is the only variable element and the main topic in this film- how to be happier. Such as the beautiful woman’s face was destroyed, then she got a divorce, and felt devastated. However, her attitude towards life changed her state of mind and makes her feel happiness again. It also uses counter-examples to argue that circumstances don’t influence one’s happiness. Such as The original people who are poor and live like savages, but as a group, they always stick together, sing, dance all the time, making themselves always feel happy. The audiences might be causal viewers. Since this film is trying to persuade people the ways to make themselves happy from both internal and external. The external ways of being happy are to focus on success and reputations and so on meanwhile internal ways are to focus on personal growth, to have close friends and family, to achieve personal contribution to the world. Secondly, the director introduces theories about being happy to purposefully make people have clear concept about happiness. I generally like this film, since it combines science with literature. The combination makes its theory more believable. Especially between the comparison between cities- Japan, Bhutan, and Denmark, Japan is highly developed but however under pressure and unhappy. Bhutan, poorer but happier because of the closer nature contacts, and Denmark, having free health care ands education, and people start to live as a bigger groups, such as 20 families as a group. This changing of living behavior makes people in Denmark feels much love from the community and become happier. This rhetorical device makes people understand that intentional behaviors is important. This film makes me understand happy emotions from another aspect- science so that I can view my own emotion in a more fair way. Also in the film, the director introduces a new way of being happy- meditation, which is triable for a lot of casual viewers. I would love to give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars, since its logic is clear and fluent for viewers and sure I would recommend it to my friends.

I really like the movie "Happy", but honestly it's a bit sad. I think many of us take trivial things very seriously in order to become happy. Assuming you make a certain amount of money and the money is no longer available to people, money and clothing and everything you seek will not really make you happy. Deep down, I think we all know this, but I can never understand why we continue to rely on honesty to make us less happy as the main way we get happiness and satisfaction. I have also always been a victim of social stress who always wanted more than I wanted, and thought it would add real value to my life. Watching this video shows me that our thinking about happiness is backwards and we are taught to look for it in the wrong place. For example, in today's modern age, it is a general trend to see many people associate physical / tangible objects with their overall well-being. With the popularization of consumer culture and the demand for expensive, large and luxurious items, it is generally believed that their items can bring them happiness. These ideas lead to making more things, and making more things only leads to more waste, and ultimately to long-term damage to the environment.

I think "Happy" was valuable to English 23 in multiple ways. First, it ties in the the idea of "de-growth" necessary to combat the climate crisis. If extrinsic goals actually make us less happy and less satisfied, it makes sense to move over to a plenitude economy where intrinsic goals are inseparably included in the pursuit of physical things. (Flow found in gardening, less time working and more time with family, close knit communities to barter and trade.) Bhutan proves that, even though their GDP and other traditional markers of wealth are low, their people are well-cared for and happy. Bhutan's dedication to preserving their culture makes me think of a photo I once saw, where Mongolian tribespeople were dressed in their traditional clothes, on horseback, and carrying personal drones. Technology and simplicity can be intertwined, and technology and advancement alone will not bring happiness.
         	   <br><br>
And maybe having this knowledge in our arsenal of coping tools will help when the climate crisis occurs in full force.
        	   <br><br>

We've already discussed the environmental benefits of co-housing, and the social benefits are pretty obvious too. "It takes a village" is oft repeated, but little practiced. Having so many people around to help raise children, especially if someone is a single parent, can take a huge burden of stress off of parents. And considering the environmental crisis, more people could experience being a parent and caretaker without bringing the burden of another human being onto the planet. I personally love, children, and always wanted to have a few, but if I could gain the same experience of being a mother by pitching in at a co-housing community (and the Denmark segment makes it clear that people feel like an extended family) then that would be a less selfish and more environmentally sound option. Also, this ties in with the compassion and altruism bits at the end, which can't be over emphasized. Doing kind things for other people is a joy, a blessing in pure form. Isn't it already so lovely to do nice things for the people in our lives? So how about living in a community where we all go out of our way to serve one another?
        	   <br><br>

I loved the Okinawan segment, and it ties into another part of the class as well! Traditionally, Okinawans eat a mostly plant-based diet full of starchy vegetables that are grown locally--that sounds a lot like climatarianism to me! (A carb-heavy diet is an incredibly healthy diet: ask the centenarians.)
        	   <br><br>
 Even with just three examples, we can see that switching our focus on what makes us truly, genuinely happy will have a huge impact on our climate footprint.
        	   <br><br>

I'd also like to take this moment to reach out to my peers who genuinely struggle on a biochemical level to be happy. As someone with clinical depression and family members who have been in and out of behavioral health centers for similar issues and crises, I think I know a thing or two about happiness--and lack thereof.
        	   <br><br>

1. Who told you that you deserve to be happy? Who told you that happiness is your right? The preamble only mentions the "pursuit of happiness." Nothing else beyond that is guaranteed. None of us are "entitled" to happiness. I took a class on Tibetan Buddhism, and no statement from any religion has comforted me so much as the Noble Truth that "suffering is the root of life." It's a hell of a lot easier for me to accept that I live in a shitty world where our base state is sorrow than in a world where I'm meant to be happy all of the time.
        	   <br><br>

2. Understand that happiness may not be your natural state. I don't often find myself happy, but I often find myself contented, engaged, motivated, and interested in my life. You may call that happiness, but I'm not always in a "good mood" despite it. I've accepted that I'm prone to depressive episodes, and that's an incredibly freeing realization. I don't feel bad about it anymore; to make an analogy, some biomes are sunny and warm, others rainy, some frigid and dry. Why should a temperate rainforest be scolded for not having the weather patterns of a coastal chaparral? I'm a "rainy biome" so to speak, and accepting that has opened up possibilities for what I can and can't do.
         	   <br><br>
Maybe you're a rainy biome, too.
        	   <br><br>

3. Get outside (of your head). I like to walk everywhere. I listen to music all of the time. I fold laundry, I cook, I visit the beach. I do anything to distract myself from any emptiness I feel. Like Blanchard Sr stated in the film, the outside world is effective medicine. Sit in the sunshine, feel the warmth on your skin. Splash around in puddles (even as an adult, people smile when I do). Take a loop around the block. Try to never spend 24 hours indoors. Santa Barbara literally is one of the most beautiful places in California, and I've seen a lot of California. Here, we can surf, paddle-board, run or do yoga outside with scenic views, and even just wander around downtown in the most lovely of areas.
        	   <br><br>

4. Eat regularly, eat well, and make what you eat. If you're like me, and struggle with eating (whether due to a comorbid disorder  or simply that college student LYFE) try to make a meal yourself at least once a day. It connects you to your food, it's a fun way to fill up time, and it tastes better than a premade meal. When I lived in the dorms, my friends and I made stir fry and banana bread in the communal kitchens using tools that we checked out from the front desk. We had to use a tablespoon for everything (fun conversion: 16 tablespoons is one cup, and the recipe called for three cups of flour) but our food came out delicious and I treasure those memories.
        	   <br><br>

5. To quote Tony Stark: "Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep."  Keep a consistent sleep schedule, get enough, not too much. I know it sucks when you have so much work to do, and I've definitely had quarters here where I'm scheduled at least once a week for a graveyard shift, but try your best. Trying to "catch up" on sleep doesn't work well.
        	   <br><br>

6. Get involved with work you love. I love working with children, so I do education outreach in STEM. My roommate loves dogs, and volunteers at the Goleta Humane Society. My little sister sings and acts, my mother sews, my father plays Dungeons and Dragons. It doesn't have to be deep and meaningful (but I promise you, it's better if it is), but having anything that's an active hobby beyond a passive one, like watching Netflix or scrolling on Instagram, will benefit you in the long run. Also, create and keep an exercise routine, journal (even if it is just a to-do list, or a dumb joke you heard that was kind of funny), and keep yourself accountable. I personally keep a happiness journal; it feels less burdensome and patronizing than "counting my blessings" and it gives me concrete instances of moments when I was happy to look back on. If you're religious, visit a parish, recite your prayers, adhere to the traditions of your religion. (Happy Lent, my Catholic friends.) If you're spiritual, rearrange your altar, shuffle your tarot deck, brush off your birth chart, look up the current moon phase. I used to scoff at spirituality. Now it's a huge source of peace in my life, even as a STEM major.
        	   <br><br>

7. The right medication can change your life. My mother once said that antidepressants saved her life. If you can't make your own neurotransmitters, store bought is fine. Denmark, one of the featured nations in "Happy", has one of the largest per capita rates of antidepressant use. And that's fantastic, because it means that the people who need help are receiving it. I used to have a severe vitamin D deficiency, and took prescription supplements for it. I'd honestly say now that my mental illness is 50% easier to manage; not everything feels like the end of the world. Get a complete blood check, take the pills your psychiatrist or your doctor gives you, and for the love of God Herself, not only should you not skip your therapy appointments but you should also do the homework your therapist gives you (I'm still working on the last one). If you can't afford/don't have access to professional help, I'd say take a multivitamin, take a breath, and try to do some of the other suggestions that the film or this list made.

No matter what your situation is, you have this. You can be happy.

I’ve always noticed the headlines: technology making Americans less satisfied, more money doesn’t mean more happy, etc etc. Correspondingly, I’ve reflected and realized that in my own life, the happiest memories do in fact correspond to times that technology had little to no part of the experience. Whether it be literally off-grid in nature, or just being with friends and family playing board games and cooking, I felt most connected ironically when I wasn’t “connected” (virtually) at all. The reason I bring up the presence of technology is because I feel that most of our climate issues correlate directly to the technologies in our lives, even if the connection may not be obvious. The best times weren’t shopping for excess clothing items; they weren’t in transportation, they weren’t through any sort of online connectivity- which is where Ken’s argument on the climate crisis comes in. I for one believe 1000% that we would all be much better off in a society that prohibited fossil fuels and the “goods/resources” we get from them (ie excess stuff and technologies). At the end of the day, very few will truly suffer from the loss of private transportation or plastic or fossil fuels in general if we do the transition to renewable energy right. I simply wish that everyone could hear and understand this idea as well as people like the makers of “Happy” and Ken do…

Our pursuit of happiness is dangerous and detrimental to the planet. The fact that people are tending to be less happy than ever can be attributed to being too consumed by the pursuit. We constantly strive for bigger and better and this constant focus on what's next can prevent us from truly enjoying and getting value from the current wave of things we have. A big part of your happiness is the mindset that you approach life with, since our daily habits play such a large role in our happiness. The hedonic treadmill offers explanation for our pursuit, since we are able to go on relatively unaffected after a positive or negative occurrence in our lives after a short time. We have to be able to find happiness in the little things and the non material things such as relationships and lifestyles. With that being said, while many people believe the saying that "money doesn't buy happiness", one of the main reasons we struggle to find happiness in the things we already have and the non material things is because we are too consumed in the desire to make money. You need to have relative comfort if you want be able to focus on the non-essential aspects of your life. Having money gives security which allows you to explore and diversify.

This film is really a different from all the other films and readings mentioned in the course. Surprisingly, climate crisis and carbon footprint is not the main topic of it, and this film even did not mention much about it. Instead, just as what the title of the film shows, it is all about happy. I Think this film is great, and this can be the film which I most agree with. I totally agree with the film that happiness is the most important thing for a person. The final reason why we want all the other things, like money or love, is to make ourselves happy. We should not sacrifice our own happiness for any of those things. Thus, I also agree that things like money should not determine our happiness. 

 After watching the lecture, I was also surprised that this film can be relative to the general theme of our course climate crisis. However, I really agree with the professor’s idea that people can be happy without that large carbon footprint. All the ways like being vegetarian or life in cities may not do harm to the happiness of a person for most us. Maybe, something of the list of the 20 action can make a person. I think the person can just get rid of it, because there are a lot of other things they can do to actually change the climate crisis

Yes! I just really love the movie “Happy”. The theme of our movie focuses on happiness and scientists keep dedicating in research on what makes you happy. The film introduces different ways to be happy such as “gorilla run”, surfing in Brazil, and climbing in the zone. These all different forms of feeling happy but there is something in common: they share a sense of tranquility and harmony. No matter what you do, no matter what moment are you in, people are on a regular basis can feel happy. There is a quote: “one of the key ingredients to happiness is being able to recover from adversity” which gives me strength the most. I wrote an essay about how I overcome adversity before because after suffering something bad, I still can feel happy and good as other normal children. People can feel happy in different places. You feel happy when you buy a skirt. You feel happy when you eat delicious food. You feel happy when you travel. You feel happy when you win a competition. You can also feel happy when you recover from adversity like the woman who experienced a disfigurement or me. When you have basic needs to support lives, personal growth, strong relationships, and other intrinsic support to fulfill your happiness.

“It doesn’t make sense to make money for yourself, when you don’t take care of yourself..” When Ronaldo Fadul - a surfer from Brazil said this, I realized that we’re so focused on achieving the American Dream that we don’t take time to consider if we’re really happy. The desire to climb the ladder pushes us to disengage from our family and friends - the support we all need to truly be happy. This also connects to Melissa Moody’s story.  I was extremely shocked when Melissa Moody was explaining how she was having an argument with her sister-in-law that led to a terrible accident that changed her life forever. After her accident she didn’t have the support she needed from her husband, which resulted in her being depressed and even suicidal. This proved that you can have everything you want in life: expensive clothes, cars, big houses, etc, but the moment you lose the love and compassion from family (the true value), life gets hard.  Furthermore, when the man in Japan said it was his birthday but he was spending it with colleagues rather than his girlfriend or family because business is more important, I was surprised! Really makes you think about what people consider important in their lives and why the planet is in such a state. Nevertheless, I’m very proud of Bhutan. The world looks at wealthy super nations as the US as an example on how to lead and live, when in reality everyone should be looking up to Bhutan, I applaud the leaders of this country for valuing the happiness of their people first. It just makes perfect sense; happier people just do way better in life and that is what makes a country grow and prosper in a beautiful way. Hence, the main thing that I learned or reinforced was my idea that family is the most important, valued thing in life. I’ll always put family over anything and to me that makes me happy and satisfied in life.

The words of Benjamin, “The constitution only guarantees the American People the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it by yourself” impressed me most at the beginning of this movie. Every one wants to be happy, but what the deep and genuine happiness is has been researched for many years by experts. From my perspective, happiness is the base of our daily life that influence our occupations, moods, etc. According to the pie chart, 50% of happiness are set when we were born and 10% about social circumstances, the left 40% depends on intentional activity so that people are supposed to adapt what they are doing and vary to be happy，like doing novel things, physical activities，working in the community, and saving tiny life. In this movie, the woman who survived from a truck accident let me feel satisfied and optimistic about my current life. And in Japan, that citizens work themselves to death is so beneath. As research shows, although people’s salary continues to rise, people’s sense of happiness fluctuates to a small extent and almost remains the same as the origin. What I learned from this documentary is that when I care about something bigger than myself, I am cultivating happiness, and “the things we love to do are the building blocks of a happy life.”

The film "Happy" argues that the pursuit of happiness should be spiritual rather than material. The director expressed his understanding of happiness by interviewing four totally different persons. For Manoj, happiness means a tight-knit family. A good relationship with a neighbor and family would give one strength to embrace life though in a poor living environment. For most, the goal of hard work is to earn more money and have a higher quality of life. However, for Ronaldo, surfing is his goal and happiness. For forty years, surfing has been a significant part of his life. When others were falling with age, Ronaldo was rising with every wave he caught. It was Melissa who made me learn about a new way to face life. She was so miserable that losing the most important thing for a girl, appearance.

I think happiness is that I integrate into society again at that time. I nearly lost my right hand by an accident when I was six. At least two years, I could not use my right hand to do anything. Inconvenient life and little care in the school made me pessimistic. I spent more time on mental treatment, thus having similar resonance on sedimental with Melissa. Japanese kept a low level of happiness for several years due to their stress work. Some even work themselves to death. Hiroko’s family is a representative example. Hiroko’s husband was still working at the last moment of his life. Maybe her husband was an excellent worker, but also a failed father, even not leaving a deep impression on his daughter.

In the film, happy and they discuss how happiness in different parts of the world differently compared to culture and changes. Who is very interesting and gave me a better outlook on what I do in my life that makes me happy. I feel at the moment that I am stressed a lot in the summer when I’m a regular job, and I’m not going to college will be a lot of stress and have a healthier mental balance. The way our economy set up encourages consumption, and I would say that in many of the other countries, it is the same but two different degrees. America has waste that her job to chase material possessions to no end. It’s no longer considering meeting the Bare Necessities and being able to survive; it’s gotten to a point where you have to consume to be happy. But this is not providing any more satisfaction. But it is not delivering any more happiness than we had before and they were meeting Bare Necessities.

It’s pretty sad that humans have created so much pain over something that only has value because we gave it value. The part of ‘Happy’ about Karoshi in Japan was really heartbreaking and it really made me angry about the globalization of these Western ideals. It seems pretty obvious that the main goal of our societies should be the health and well-being of the people, but that is absolutely not the priority in America. No wonder Americans are so unhappy, when everything in our culture is focused on getting money out of us, creating more pressure to make money. It just seems so illogical when we are literally in control of how we live our lives. We don’t need to grow just for the sake of growth. We just need to prioritize harmony and happiness. This would eliminate so many problems.
        	   <br><br>

I also thought it was very interesting to see the Ju/‘hoansi community in the movie. I had also learned about the Ju/‘hoansi in one of my other classes, and we learned that a huge part of why they got along so well is because they mostly ate plant foods, leading to more gender equality and an egalitarian society. It’s so true that when you put a group of people together their instinct is to cooperate. Capitalism, which forces everyone to think of only themselves and their wealth, deprives people of happiness and goes against our instinct. Maybe that’s why Americans also put so much value into their nuclear families, because they lack any other close relationships. It seems pretty clear that we should move towards well-being for all as quickly as possible, but there are also centuries of hateful and competitive narratives in the way of everyone agreeing on that.

I agree with your “nuclear family” comment. People tend to only care about their immediate family because they have not formed relationships with their community or other people. And how exactly would they be able to when society literally forces them to care about themselves and economic growth. The american dream was a force of inspiration, but now it's merely a nightmare. So many people are stuck on this old “american dream” where you can be and do whatever your heart desires, become successful - but this dream was built on a foundation of suffering and misguided individualism. Everyone has the right to express their individualism, but not at the cost of other people's lives and the planet. 
        	   <br><br>
We are in control of our lives - but so many people are not and we tend to forget about that. In fact, many people are not in control of their lives because of us, can you just see the injustice in that. Because of our fossil fuel addicted culture, innocent people in the middle east are subjected to perpetual war and famine because our military serves as a policing force for the fossil fuel industry. Or the people in Bangladesh that are living in polluted environments because of our unwavering need for fast fashion. 
        	   <br><br>
Like you said, we need to prioritize harmony and happiness and it would eliminate so many problems - but first we need to fight and defeat all the powerful industries that are working twice as hard to keep the status quo.

I would definitely agree with the claim that this film "Happy" is suggesting, that we are destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness. I think that the "American dream" has a different meaning today than it did in the early 20th century. The "American dream" was once the idea that hard work would create opportunities for success, but today I would argue that the "American dream" consists of making a six figure salary at any expense to buy bigger and better things. The film describes how once you have your basic needs fulfilled, such housing and food, excess materials goods does not create extra happiness. I think that today we live in a society that is constantly trying to sell us the newest and "best" things on the market by promoting consumption in order to increase the nation's economic GDP. I think the film does a good job of providing examples of individuals and communities who are happy even though they do not have a lot of material goods. We see how much these people value their relationships, health, and their opportunities to help others. This way of thinking provides them with a sense of purpose which brings them more happiness than any material good could. When you stop thinking about what you want and focus on what you have and appreciate those things you will become a happier person. I think this film does a good job of calling out our capitalistic and consumerist economy and showing how you can live a meaningful life with the simple things.

I enjoyed watching this video because it had a much different focus than our usual videos.I definitely believe that there is something seriously misguided about our view of the pursuit of happiness and that this view is extremely harmful to the environment. It is constantly proven that consumerism leads to a very brief, short-term joy, that leaves people wanting more, instead of feeling fulfilled. This clearly leads to wastefulness, when people are consistently buying things that they do not need, and many times don't even use. What we see in the video is that in reality, what really makes people happy is not money or material, but rather actions such as participating in acts of kindness and good deeds or having close relationships with other people. However, this is only true to a certain extent. From experience, I can definitely say that having money has an impact on people’s happiness. Of course, having money does not guarantee happiness, but not having money is one of the leading causes of stress. I feel like it is very naive to say that money doesn’t buy happiness because that is simply not how our system is built. Something that I found especially interesting in the video was when it was explaining the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic values. They explained that many times these two views can contradict each other. The argument was that each person has a personal desire to do good, however, in our society doing good is not seen as attractive or cool. Therefore how we want others to view our own image conflicts with our own desires. I found this very interesting because I feel like I see this contradiction among my peers very often. It is definitely true that many people see caring as uncool, which is incredibly sad and extremely harmful in countless ways. This is why it is so important to have opinions about controversial topics and to be proud of your views and to actively stand up for them.

The part of this film about conflict is probably what made me think the most. It's probably because I've already been thinking about it quite a bit-- cognitive bias and all-- but I wonder how much of our fight, of fighting as a whole, is because... well... we need to. Because we have to have an enemy, some kind of struggle to overcome, or we become lost and listless. I often wonder how much of the fight against climate change makes us happier because it naturally would, and how much of it is because it is a fight and takes steps against it is winning. What I'm saying, is, really: what if the happiness of some of these low-carbon lifestyles (at least in the US, not in places where it is low-carbon not out of choice) is because of the conflict itself, more than the result? I know that, of course, a lot of us would be happier either way. It simply is a better way to live. But an increasingly large part of me keeps nagging about how the happiness doesn't really come from that type of life, it comes from.. well.. fighting for something. And if we "win," that happiness will fade. 

        	   <br><br>

But... that is so far in the future, so unrelated to most everything we are talking about and doing, that it doesn't really matter. This fight will likely not be over in my lifetime. Hell, it almost certainly won't be. So really... it doesn't matter if the happiness comes from the life itself or if it's from the struggle. No matter what, it's going to be there. We just have to fight, and we'll be better off either way.

In the past, I insisted on my idea that better material definitely will make us happier, but after watching this film, my idea was challenged. I started to think that as the development of economy, people did have more money than before and they had a better life than in the past. But are we really happier than in the past? I do not think so. Since we are capable of having more than in the past, we might have the desire to have more. Humans are not always satisfied with their life now, they always want more. So this desire can cause a lot of stress to humans and drive them to work harder and longer, which makes people feel unhappy. Then there is a question, what makes people feel happy. According to the statistics in the film, money and possession definitely are not the factors that bring happiness to humans. Collective culture is a way that brings happiness to humans. Collective culture means community life. According to the film, the filmmaker finds that when people live in groups, they are happier. People who do not live with others will feel lonely and have more negative emotions. But right now I am considering why this film is connected with environmental issues. I finally understand that if people live in a group, it can bring a positive influence to the environment. Since living together can save energy and reduce waste. And it is much more effective to solve the environmental issues since people gathering together can come up with more ideas and solutions. But if everyone lives alone. It would increase the waste and the cost to live, since everyone should be responsible to their parts and cannot share with others. For example, in family life, several people can eat a big bread together so that this bread will not be wasted. But if someone lives alone, this bread is too big for a person, this food might be wasted. Although this seems independent with environmental issues, I think the lifestyle mentioned in this film is also an eco-friendly lifestyle which we can learn from it.

The overall idea of the film is to emphasize that happiness can be achieved through various ways and overconsumption and excessive wealth cannot bring joy. The trick to gain happiness not only lies on our genetic basis, but it also largely depends on what we do. Good things and bad things that happened on us has, in fact, little to do with our extent of happiness.
        	   <br><br>

 An Indian father lives in a poor home which cannot even provide shelter against storms. He has to work very hard to make a living for the entire family. Sometimes he might also be abused by his clients, but he dares not to quarrel with them for the sake of earning money. If he does it once, he would lose a client permanently. However, he is still optimistic toward life. There is also a woman who used to be beautiful. She lost her beauty in an accident and her husband left her. However, after physically recovering from the accident, she still decides to live optimistically and married with her new lover. Though their lives are unfortunate, they still pursue their happiness in their own way. 
        	   <br><br>

 Scientific researches also show that doing sports can greatly enhance our extent of happiness, especially doing sports in novel ways. One of them is called animal running, which requires people to dress up like animals. In such way, people get to experience sports in an innovative way and thus feel happy. 
        	   <br><br>

 Another prominent aspect is that living harmoniously with neighbors would make people happy as well. There is a community of old people who would gather frequently and enjoy meals together. Sometimes they would catch crabs for their meals. People in this community enjoy their life very much. They are close friends and family to each other. Another example is a divorced mother who, along with her daughter, moved into a community house where people share many public places. They have meals together and one person would only have to make meals about once a week such that they don’t have to worry about what to eat every day. Children also get to play together and share some responsibility in cooking (mostly wash vegetables).
        	   <br><br>

 Contradictions between Japan and Bhutan also draws suggests problems with our modernization and industrialization. Bhutan focuses on gross domestic happiness more than just GDP. This country provides free education and devotes much money into infrastructures. They still have many traditional sports and activities rather than letting modern-day entertainments replace them. On the contrary, Japans pushes too hard on its economic growth such that it almost ignores people’s happiness. In the film, a Japanese father spent most of his time working such that he rarely has time accompanying his daughter. He even had to work during holidays.  Because of such pressure, he died at a young age, leaving his wife and daughter behind.
        	   <br><br>

 Compassion is also a determinant of happiness. People who have more compassion tend to live more happily. In a school mentioned in the film, students are educated on compassion frequently in ways of inviting those who are bullied or laughed at all the time to share their experiences. Other students get to know how they really feel. In this manner, students are educated to have compassion. In addition, people in some African tribe are also very compassionate. Although they live in a primitive society, they still live happily and they are very concerned about each other’s wellbeing. Whenever their tribe members are sick, everyone would participate in the healing ceremony to express their compassion toward the patients. Other than these, there is a caring place in India to take care of dying people in hopes that they would recover or at least enjoy the final stage of their life.

My heart just about exploded when I heard the Denmark mother’s explanation for hanging empty frames on the walls of her small community home. It encouraged her daughters to continue making art to fill all of the spaces and it truly made me smile to hear her parenting style. This film introduced me to living communities and styles that I was unfamiliar with made me feel refreshed. It made me eager to travel and be enriched by the amazing, loving elderly community of Okinawa. I had to take a second away from the computer screen and think about how much I don’t prioritize my sleep.

I’m writing with actual tears in my eyes after hearing about the genuine care and love given to the people of Kolkata, India. The man they interviewed has a special place in my heart because of the kind of man of God that he is. The level of care that that facility gives to their patients makes me eager to volunteer again in a third world country. Giving something as simple as a glass of water to a patient can be such a small act, but it shows them that they are loved even alone on their deathbed. It encourages me to transform my brain and life to be more compassionate and loving in everything I do. I need to appreciate the things that I have more than I am now. I take for granted the things that come easy far too often. This film was a moment of realization and awakening that my heart needed to be more motivated to heal my heart and others around me in the process.

The film "Happy" points out the essence of happiness is not the pursuit of money and stuff but is to help others. It illustrates two types of people, people with intrinsic goals and people with extrinsic goals, and it highlights people with intrinsic goals will be happier since they pursue to help others. Also, the film mentions that joining in a community and having a connection with others will make people happy. The film utilizes co-housing, which takes place in Denmark, as an example to show the joy that people live in a community. Furthermore, the film underscores people who live in Okinawa that form a community and hold lots of activities, and people who live there are very happy and their lifespans are very long. However, most people in Japan are working more than 60 hours per week, and many people die because of overtired. The film underlines that people who are poor are not happy, but if the money they earned can subsist their basic needs, it is not necessary to pursue to earn more. 
           	   <br><br>
  Ken also noted that happiness is not related to money, and people in the US are not the happiest in the World, even though the US emits a quarter of CO2 into the atmosphere. Therefore, happiness is irrelevant to CO2 footprint and stuff people own. People in Sweden are much happier than people in the US since the US is ranked as #19 in the UN report and Sweden is #7. Nevertheless, Sweden produces only a fourth of the US GHG emission. Furthermore, Sweden is even further North than the US, which means that they need to consume energy for heating. People in Sweden are happier than people in the US is because the government in Sweden cares more about the well-being of their citizens instead of corporate interest. For instance, retirement benefits and health care are ensured, and college education and graduate education are free. In addition, people work about 30 hours per week in Sweden compared with most people work about 50 hours per week in the US. In a word, happiness is not to own lots of stuff and emit lots of CO2 but to have a connection with others. Additionally, the government plays an important role in facilitating people's "pursuit of happiness".

I found this to be really interesting because in the end, everyone around the world wants to be happy. While this is the case, you would think we in the US have more resources to be more happy, but I believe these resources in the end work against us. We as a society have been taught that if we are not happy or in anyway unfulfilled, it is important to fill that void with stuff. This has evolved our culture to buying as much as we can, and this ultimately has increased our climate footprint. Because of this, it is important that we monitor our happiness. Personally I have felt myself become unhappy and fall into the trap of buy and using stuff as a source of comfort, but as made clear in the video, that comfort is short lived. I had my tight knit family back home and my volunteer position as a youth coach that gave me a sense of belonging that I was making a difference in peoples' lives by helping them to grow. This gave me great happiness to the point I was ecstatic if my players succeeded. It helped me in many ways and gave me something to focus one. Working out also does the same for me. It takes me out of the stress of my daily life and gives me something else to focus on instead. It allows me to feel fresh again if that makes sense. This sort of refresh makes me happy and care about everything around me, and that is the type of attitude we need to save our planet. If no one was happy, no one would care because it not important to them, and at that point no one would be doing anything to save the Earth or help their fellow man. The video "Happy" reminded me how important our bonds are with people and the natural world. It allows us to really stay Intune with others and grounded instead of only being in our own worlds. 
        	   <br><br>
While watching the video I kept thinking of when I was little, and how I used to be concerned with everyone and everything. If everyone was like that now, I don't think we would be in this current crisis because everyone would be looking for a solution, if not for themselves, for the person next to them. This is why places like Sweden have low emissions and are so happy. Happiness turns into care and by caring for one another, they do what they can to watch out for each other and future generations by protecting our planet. With our resources in the US, we should be less focused on how we can get more stuff as a nation, and focus more on how we can use that wealth to help and better other nations who need it for basic needs, so they too can be happier.

I agree this film was really interesting to watch. I find what you said to be really interesting that in the US we have more resources to be happy. But this film showed that resources do not make us happy. In the beginning of the film I was shocked to discover that only 10% of our happiness comes from the situations we are in. But for some reason as you mentioned in America we think we need to fill a void of unhappiness with stuff.  I agree with you as the film mentioned instead we can find happiness through helping others and spending time with loved ones. Along with this I agree working out takes away all of the stress in my life and gives me happiness. I feel like it is a great way to help my brain relax and it also helps me sleep better at night. I agree that having a happy attitude is one we need to transfer towards helping the planet.

I found what you said about how we think as a child very interesting. As children we are constantly told to help your friends and take care of others. Then now as adults we are constantly in competition. Whether we are competing for the highest grade in a class or a better internship. The way our society works is to walk over others to help yourself, instead of working together. As the film mentioned I think if we focus more on cooperation our world would be in a way better place. Along with this I was shocked with the happiness levels, that as a country who consumes the most we are number 19 on the happiness scale. I think if we focused on helping others as you stated we would be in a way better ranking.

The film “Happy” preached the values and ideals that I want to undeniably follow in my life. These intrinsic values include: personal growth, desire for meaning/purpose and close relationships. I have always wanted to have a meaningful life, I don’t know what that is for me yet. I also work hard for close friendships and family, and I do believe I have these. Though, sometimes I get lost in the “sauce” as my friends would call it. Society has told me that I need that Mcmansion, the tesla, the patagonia, the iphone and all the other shallow “designer” brands. I long for these material items and to have the best “insta feed” because it has been grilled into me through media and advertisements. The rise of social media, I believe, has made it worse for my generation to deal with vanity, materialism and consumerism. You know what I say? FUCK IT. down with this capitalist system. As shown you don’t need these items. Do what makes you happy, be active and spend time with loved ones. Fuck that other bullshit. You do you. Treat yourself. Be happy. Save the planet.

I loved reading your comment and I completely agree. Our society has found a way to monetize our happiness. They tell us we need all these things to be happy and improve our lives, and we believe it. The story progresses by most of us becoming obsessed with working hard and becoming 'successful' and 'rich'. It sad because we're being completely misguided. What stood out to me when I saw this film was all the science behind the concept of happiness. I learned that we are literally born with genes that determine a range of our happiness. I was also reminded that physical activity releases dopamine which makes us feel happy. It made me realize why I always feel so positive after going on a run or finishing a yoga class. We get so caught up in a chase of happiness that we're in this endless cycle that society sets up for us, like a hamster on a wheel. The movie introduced the idea of, 'flow', which is when you're in the zone. It can be anything you enjoy or are passionate about in life, playing the piano, rock climbing, cooking, dancing, garden. The more people can find their flow the more we can be happy and fulfilled in life. Furthermore, after hearing the story of the woman who survived being ran over by a truck, I was shocked to finally understand that the key to true happiness comes from recovering from adversity quicker. I am not perfect, I get frustrated very easily, I'm stubborn, but what this movie showed me is that there is no pleasure without pain. We can buy all the fast fashion and beef that we want, but that is hurting the environment. The same goes for burning fossil fuels to run our capitalist economy, we can utilize all the benefits but the environment can't sustain it any longer. We have to make a shift like the shift set out in the Green New Deal. There is really no point in continuing this amazing economic growth we keep talking about, because the average happiness of humans is not increasing exponentially. We are destroying the planet and destroying ourselves for basically no reason. My favorite quotes from the movie were from Ronaldo Fadul the surfer. He said, "It doesn't make sense to make money for yourself, when you don’t take care of yourself, when you’re not dreaming or happy." and, "Try to work so you’ll be able to live you life in tranquility." Like you said in your comment, we need to value our personal growth and our relationships. We can do that by finding our flow and spending valuable time with friends and family, not constantly working to make more money.

Yes, we are. Though I am an environmental study major student before. But I have to say, what I pursuit for my whole life is just pleasure. My own satisfaction is the biggest thing I flighted for until right now. though it is true that I have a bicycle that can help me ride to school every day. But just after I bought my new car, I do not want to ride to school anymore. It is more convenient for me to drive to school instead of riding. But after I read the whole chapter. I understand the importance of saving. For me, what I will try to do in the future is just more riding a bike but driving a car.

The film "Happy" did a wonderful job depicting happiness in the simplest ways in all parts of the world. It shows that with very little, a person can be as happy as someone with many more material things. Seeing the negative side affects of the corporate and hardworking culture of Japan reminded me of corporate America. People push themselves to make more money and be able to afford more things, which is ultimately wasteful and useless in regard to one's happiness level. The part of the film I enjoyed the most was the man who found his happiness in surfing. He lived in an extremely modest home, had a few articles of clothing, and his surfboard. It is inspiring to see someone lead such a sustainable and happy life without really even trying. Seeing the beauty in the world is much more important than seeing the beauty in material things, and I hope that one day everyone will realize this point.

I also enjoyed seeing how happiness is illustrated in different parts of the world. We live in a society where the majority of people see material possessions as the main source of happiness. People work restlessly to be able to afford a lavish lifestyle in hopes it will bring them happiness. This past summer I went to mexico and a relative mentioned the fast-paced lifestyle in the US. He said people are always in a rush to get to work, and work is always an excuse to miss out on happiness. We work long hard hours to continue living a lifestyle that leaves us dissatisfied and exhausted. I think when we learn to be content with what we own and look for happiness in oneself, others, and nature, then we will be happy.

 I believe adjusting our mindset about corporate America is crucial to our happiness for the rest of our lives. I don't know if it ever will adapt, however other countries are leading this attribute with such ease that it seems like a viable option for us at some point.

Happiness is a very important part of people's lives. It boosts overall morale and even your productivity in your day to day job or even school work like in the case of many of the people in this class. I know when I'm down and flat out not having a good time, I am not productive at all and oftentimes find myself sitting there with my work in front of me, not doing anything. A lot of people find joy in many things such as hobbies, exercise, and in some cases, shopping. I know the consumer industry wants us to buy their products thinking it'll make us feel better so they advertise that if we buy their product we WILL feel better. Most of the time we don't. It's sad to see that we are being taken advantage of by these companies in order to put more money in their pockets. It not only hurts society as a whole but the planet as well because if we keep buying, they'll keep producing. Finding different ways to make yourself happy is very important. We have to be able to better ourselves and society. Buying something does nothing for us. If we find better ways to make ourselves happy, who knows what we could do.

I think both of these readings were really insightful. The first reading really helped me understand what we can do moving forward in order to stop the detrimental everyday usage of carbon. Before reading this chapter I had no clue what the difference was between cap and trade and auctioned caps nor did I understand the difference between a fee and a tax. However, I now understand these concepts and think that they are very important to implement in the upcoming years. It is especially important that we develop a carbon fee as this is the one method that can help us transition in a way that is affordable and beneficial to those that are less fortunate and use less carbon than others.  At the end of the day this all comes back to the same concept that Ken has been stressing this entire quarter: Voting. We need more people to become aware of their actions and to vote for candidates that support a greener future. If we do not we will continue down this damaging path and leave nothing but a disaster for future generations to come.

I found the chapter on leaving fossil fuels behind a little redundant but nevertheless it was a good review of what we have learned in this class so far. However, this reading did make me think more about how the use of fossil fuels is integrated into our learning system. Everyday kids attend colleges all over the world and often times these schools are very far away from home. This encourages kids to fly or drive, burning lots of fossil fuels frequently throughout the year. This happens everytime we get a break from school and is especially true for international kids who fly back home over break. What is unfortunate is that it seems as if colleges frequently accept kids that are from out of state instead of local kids in order to receive a much higher tuition payment.

I would like to leave off this comment with a quote that I found very important: 
        	   <br><br>

“As I discussed in Chapter 5, a sustainable human civilization will require us to reorganize around an economic system that doesn’t depend on growth. We’ll also need to find a way to maintain a stable population within the Earth’s carrying capacity. One way or another, either through conscious planning or col- lapse, physics requires that our current growth-based system must change.
         	   <br><br>
We need strict new campaign finance laws: corporations must not be allowed to con- tribute to political campaigns, and neither should any sort of organization. We need a system in which politicians aren’t expected to or allowed to accept money from donors. And corporate lobbying should quite simply be illegal.45”

I have to agree that watching “Happy” for the second time was better than the first. In regard to Ken’s question, I do think that if I personally implement these changes into my life that I will become happier. By going vegan/climatarian, not only would my body feel physically better, but I would also be happier knowing that I’m not eating an animal. These changes would make me happier by knowing that I am doing something in my own life for the good of the planet. When Ken stated that the average Swedish person contributes only ⅓ of the average Americans footprint, I felt disgusted. And then to find out its equivalent to almost a ⅛ due to the cooler climate. This shows us how unaware and selfish we are here in America. We have multiple cars per family and cry if we don’t get our own room. Yet, when we have all those things, it still isn’t enough to make us happy. It is instilled in us Americans that we need to have more to be happy and that we cannot be happy with settling for what we have. “Strive for more” is something my grandfather used to tell me when I was younger. Looking back, I wish he would’ve just told me to be happy with what I have and be grateful. I don’t need a $600 purse every year to make me happy. I need sustainable food and a nice blanket to sit outside on. There are people dying from overworking their bodies and people losing interest in their own lives. We have lost sight of what happiness really is.

I completely agree with your point that implementing many of the changes will naturally make someone happier. This to me was evidently clear through my own experience with eating more sustainably and the effect it had on my body. I successfully cut out meat and dairy for about a week and a half and gave in when I went to dinner and got a bowl of pasta with LOTS of cheese. I genuinely felt sick to my stomach after because I became accustomed to not ingesting "baby calf growth fluid". It is crazy to me how this was only after a week of vegan eating.  Naturally, and sometimes without noticing, changes that are better for the environment are better for your body and have a significant impact on the environment as well as one's health. My dad has been vegan for a few months now and after talking climate change I talked to my whole family regarding going vegan as a family. My dad expressed to many surprise that he had already been vegan for his body and health but was extremely excited to know the environmental impacts!

I think Ken makes an interesting point that we are told cutting back on carbon will deprive us of our freedoms in our everyday life. However, this is largely untrue as his lecture video mentions that the top eight ranked happiest countries in the world all have considerably smaller carbon footprints than the United States. Therefore, the fact that these countries emit less carbon emissions, which may contribute to them living more meaningful lives than most Americans. Perhaps this is because Americans are taught that consumption brings fulfilling rewards. Consuming is a cycle that leads to the individual always wanting more and feeling unsatisfied. Consuming is also a cycle of emitting additional greenhouse gases into the environment. Then it is likely that carbon-emitting activities are not what makes us happy. If this is true, we can learn to diminish our eco-footprint without diminishing our personal happiness.

The happiness documentary really hit home for me. With all of the climate change documentaries, they seemed pretty repetitive with the main idea being that climate change is a human caused important issue here are the steps that you can do to change it. What I liked about this documentary was how happiness can relate to personal action against climate change. Currently, it helped me reflect on my own life. I have been questioning my major quite a bit lately and contemplating really what I want in my own life and what would make me happy. Would becoming a doctor satisfy me because of the sense of achievement and the relief of not worrying about money? Or would pursuing a less wealthy path such as art or politics make me the happiest? 
        	   <br><br>
I have always been fascinated with minimalism and have never been the type of person to spend money or want any new items. For me, even now, I was shocked to know that the average American spends $6,000 a year on new stuff. I also liked how the documentary talked about the release of dopamine through activities instead of stuff. It seems almost as if everyone in America is seeking out happiness in material items, when in fact, we need to look at relationships between family and friends and activities that release dopamine. 
        	   <br><br>
In relation to other countries, it is interesting to me how the happiest ones have free healthcare and free college. I think about how a huge weight would be lifted off of my shoulders if college was free. I would not be as afraid to make the commitment to my major if the money factor was involved. However, it makes me afraid to spend $30,000 a year on college knowing that I will get into so much debt and might change my mind about my major. I also think about how much stress would be taken off of my parent’s shoulders if they didn’t have to worry about spending all of their hard-working money on my college. I also think it would be easier if we didn’t have to worry about the cost of healthcare. If there is an emergency with one of my family member’s health, it would put us in a very difficult financial situation. It also makes me nervous if my dad’s kidney fails again. Then, he would have to get another kidney transplant, which will cost us thousands of dollars. For the most part, my family is pretty well-off financially, so I can only imagine the stress that other less fortunate families go through on a daily basis. Healthcare should be a universal right, yet it costs an insane amount just for an ambulance ride.  Therefore, it really makes sense why these countries are happier.

I completely agree with you. Despite the fact that Happy is not an environmental film, it definitely deserves a spot in the top three films (from this class) that I think were most interesting and transparent. This film is a breath of fresh air since it doesn’t follow the same structure as other documentaries and thereby doesn’t depict ideas that seem redundant. Like you, it also allowed me to reflect upon my own actions since, as I’ve previously mentioned in my commentary for the film Minimalism, I am guilty of purchasing too many items that hold absolutely no sentimental value; and not only have they emptied my wallet, but they have also admittedly done a pitiful job of making me feel satisfied with my lifestyle for more than just a day. What I hadn’t realized until watching this film is that as America progressively becomes more materialistic, we concurrently and consequently become much more less happy. The film highlights that most of us who indulge in shopping sprees only do so in hopes of becoming someone else, someone that we perceive to be happy and as living the ‘perfect life.’ I find that since purchasing certain items will only make one temporarily happy, we consistently look to find what we should buy next, consequently allowing ourselves to get chained to the rhythm and as a result unfortunately and unknowingly contributing to climate change. I overall enjoyed watching this film and have found it a bit more influential than previous films although it doesn’t depict the dangers of climate change and does not offer any solutions as well.

A word that Ken kept saying that got me thinking was the word average. When reading the assigned chapters above it was written that, “in the US, the richest 20% are responsible for 32% of emissions, whereas the poorest 20% are responsible for only 9% of emissions.” So back to the word average. While I consider myself to be not rich and not poor, but somewhere in between, these numbers are still worrisome. We always talk about how the US average is much higher than that of other countries, but when you look inside the US, you can see who is responsible for almost a third of the emission. I would go out on a limb and say that a majority of the richest 20% do not believe in climate change and are the people/ companies that the US government is looking out for.

Happy is an astounding documentary searching for what makes people happy. It was crazy to see that a rickshaw driver in India was found to be as happy as the average American. It was also interesting to see that 50% of our differences in happiness levels is decided by our genes, 40% by intentional behavior to make themselves happier, such as exercise, and only 10% by circumstances like incomes and social status. It is crazy that in today’s society we measure happiness and success by how much money you make even though your circumstances only account for 10% of our happiness. I believe we are definitely destroying our planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness. Our society is so money oriented that we focus so heavily on everything money can buy us such as clothes, bigger houses, etc. all the things that in reality do not make us happier in the long run. It was uplifting to see places such as Bhutan that prioritizes is citizen’s gross national happiness and how the community relies on the government to create an environment for happiness. It is interesting to note that in one of the most industrialized countries, most people are depressed. The fact that in Japan they have a word for working themselves to death “karoshi” is terrifying. However, another island in Japan, Okinawa, has some of the oldest people living there and the community prides itself on its agriculture and traditions that make them “one family” which they call “monchu.” The ending of this documentary was very inspirational as it talked about “thinking of happiness as a skill, like playing golf” and how the things that make people the most happy like friends and family, playing, having new experiences, doing things that are meaningful, and appreciating what we have, are ultimately free.

This documentary emphasizes how happiness does not come from the idealistic “American Dream” that individuals have created. This is a definite false representation when trying to achieve the pursuit of happiness. I genuinely do believe that we are destroying our planet in the pursuit of happiness because individuals are looking for happiness through materialistic possessions. The more items you can obtain represents that you have wealth and are successful which supposedly defines how happy you are. But, it was proven that once you obtain a livable wage and can purchase the basic necessities then you will be able to live a fulfilling and joyful life. It was said that only 10% of your potential happiness comes from your circumstances. In the film,  Denmark was said to be known as one of the happiest countries on earth as there lifestyles revolve around co-housing communities; multiple families living on one plot of land or single building. Being that it is such a close-knit community, individuals tend to create multiple connections and bonds with friends/family surrounding ultimately leading to a strong feeling of lifelong happiness. On the other hand, the individuals who lived in Japan worked such long hours and endured so much stress and frustration that they did not live a happy life. They had a strong desire to keep working and earn money that they overworked themselves to death. Ultimately, happiness comes from creating positive relationships with one another and not from money or success. Materialistic items may create a temporary/false illusion of happiness while true happiness comes from the appreciation of what surrounds you and having a sense of community. This film related to the destruction of our planet because many individuals have money-driven minds that are constantly looking for ways to obtain the new and expensive items that are causing pollution. Overall this film educates individuals that those who live a simple, modest life are way more happier than those who waste the majority of their time on earning money and achieving this so called “American Dream.”

In my opinion, your comment makes perfect sense! In our collective pursuit of happiness, we sacrifice the well-being of our planet. Our selfish reasoning for poisoning the planet only conveys the extent of our ignorance and our indifference. However, it's true that if we develop strong relationships with others rather than obtaining useless materialistic possessions, Americans would be significantly more happy without engaging in wasteful habits. Thankfully, their are classes like English 23 that provide scholars with eye-opening information as to how to live a more eco-friendly lifestyle.

Yeah, even though this film doesn’t tell us about environmental protection, it really elaborates on what makes us happy. Since happiness is the goal for everyone. The US is destroying the Earth with tremendous pollution and co2 emission even though the per person happiness is not that high. In the film, we see Japan, people working hard till death for earning money, but they are never happy. I mean I am quite shocked when I see the film, those trains pass by and every face shown on the window is tired and sorrowful. That's quite pitiful, and the sharper contrast is with Putin, a nation far less developed than Japan, they got so happy as they had a unique way for national development, they do not care about GDP, but national happiness instead. Additionally, I am really looking forward to Sweden's co-housing way of living, because it is the most efficient way to live lives, everyone cooks every 2 months for the whole 20 families. It is uneasy to develop a way into cooperation when you think about the japanese village, they were initially driven to help each other by WWII. After the film, I was thinking about my purchasing habit, it is indeed inefficient, and I am just unconsciously buying stuff and they don’t matter much to me and my happiness. I think I will get rid of it soon by consciously control my purchasing behaviors.

It was interesting to see how happy the Okinawans are and how they find happiness from living sustainably as a community. It contrasts drastically from what I know about the education and work culture in South Korea. The work environment is insanely high-pressure, fueled by the fear of unemployment (in 1997, Korea experienced a devastating economic crisis). Adolescents also experience extreme stress in order to get into the top universities and eventually obtain high-paying jobs. High school students often have a 16 hour school day; they attend after-school programs called "hagwons" for long hours and come home at around 10pm every day. The last time I went to Korea, I was in the sixth grade. I remember being shocked when we picked up my cousins from school at midnight every day. The insane amount of pressure to get into the few prestigious universities in Korea has resulted in Korea having one of the highest rates of adolescent suicide in the world, and it's because people equate money to happiness.The norm is to work and study until you destroy your mental health, leaving little time to form meaningful relationships and care for yourself. Just for the chance to climb up the social ladder and obtain wealth. This mindset obviously leaves many many people depressed and under extreme distress, but mental illness is highly stigmatized in Korea. Receiving professional help or being open about being depressed would bring shame and humiliation to your family, so people escape by suicide. If the focus shifted from money to community, like in Okinawa, these destructive social norms in Korea would become obsolete.

It was really sad to hear about Hiroko Uchino's husband's karoshi while working at Toyota, but it very much highlighted the reality of what you're talking about, the high-stress, exhausting working culture present in Asian countries like South Korea and Japan. The circumstances that led both of these nations to adopt this kind of work culture were a bit different, but they produced the same consequences at the end of the day, one of the most unfortunate ones being the sheer toll on one's mental health. I can't imagine what it would be like to live and go to school in Korea. To think that even after attending university for four years that I wouldn't be able to find a steady-paying, full-time job for a while would be extremely stressful and demoralizing; for the most part, basically one of the only ways to guarantee a nice career in Korea is to either have gone to one of the SKY universities like Yonsei, basically the Ivy Leagues of Korea, or to be conventionally attractive. Korean high schoolers spend a large chunk of their senior year preparing for a college entrance exam called the "suneung" that basically determines their lives going forward depending on how they perform; people compare it to the SAT here but I don't think that's a fair comparison considering its sheer influence and difficulty. If I was in that position, I probably would have caved from all the pressure to do really well and get into a SKY university. It doesn't surprise me at all that many Korean high-schoolers feel discontent or anxious, but what saddens me more is the stigma surrounding mental health, as you mentioned, and the lack of proper mental support systems like professional therapy. What's the point of working yourself to death if you can't enjoy the moments in the present that make life worth living? The country that stands in stark contrast to Korea and Japan, Bhutan, really intrigued me, as I had never heard of a government willing to set aside pure economic growth and progress in favor of ensuring societal happiness. It gives me hope knowing that places like this exist and can work given the right framework and mentality.

To answer Ken's question, I think that if we do succeed in shifting the lifestyles of a lot of the inhabitants of first-world countries towards a greener way of living, those people will end up being happier just because they would not only be leading healthier, more active lives but also be equipped with a greater purpose, preventing the planet from spiraling into environmental catastrophe. As Happy mentioned, life circumstances like income and social status only constitute 10% of true joy, yet it is the very thing that so many people from developed countries like Korea and Japan covet and strive for on a daily basis, whether to satisfy themselves or others like their parents. Would it not make a lot more sense to place a greater focus on the intentional activity that makes up 40% of happiness, something that boils down to how we choose to conduct our own lives and is almost entirely within our own control? Intentionally becoming more conscientious of the environment through personal actions like eating less meat, riding a bike instead of driving, or wasting less food improve one's own quality of life and wellbeing both physically and mentally. No matter how I look at it, adopting these changes just makes sense across the board.

In the documentary Happy, the filmmakers effectively discuss what truly makes people be happy. According to the survey, the fundamental composition of happiness is 50% which is genetically determined, 10% status (money/power), 40% of people could do to change. In the movie, many people in poor areas find the joy of life instead of sadness because of poverty as the public thinks. From the perspective of the rich, or people trying to become rich, wealthy and status are the keys to determining whether a person is happy or not, but this is not the case. The movie points out that external sources of happiness such as money and status can certainly affect people's happiness index, but internal sources of happiness such as personal growth, close connected relationships, and desire to help are the key. The ultimate formula of happiness is: play, new experiences, friends, and family, doing things that are meaningful, and appreciate what we have.
         	   <br><br>

In my opinion, happiness is irrespective of class, rich or poor, race, age, and everything. Human happiness is actually very simple. We may be happy because of a good grade exam, a good dream, or even a team we support. If we deliberately pursue wealth or status, then we will be disappointed and sad because we did not succeed. Once there is no desire, there will be no disappointment, then happiness can be obtained from simple and small things.

If I rate the film, I will score 7 out of 10. This is an excellent movie that tells me the philosophy of life, but the movie also has one-sidedness.

I agree with your comment. The internal sources of happiness are indeed key! When I was in Mexico during winter break, I lived in a very poor town for 3 weeks with my grandparents. Even though my grandparents live in a pretty decent home, I got to socialize and visit friends at their houses which are not rich in any way. I also ate the food they offered me which often was just a tortilla with a spoon of cheese. Everyone in that town is pretty poor and at times don’t even have food to ear. However, like thus in the film, they are the happiest people even if they do not have money. I was happy myself and at times I wish I could just stay there forever. I always laugh and enjoy everything I do over there. I truly would not mind changing my lifestyle just to pursue happiness. I also agree that if we try to pursue happiness in wealth we will suffer from disappointment. And being happy for a simple grade is much better than being happy for earning let’s say money. One should be happy for simple things like grades or dreams. I also once had a dream which was pretty fun and I can’t forget about it. B because I cannot forget about it I always recall such a dream whenever I’m down or just bored. I recall this dream because it personally just makes me very happy.

I believe the happiness comes and goes faster than we ever imagine because we crave so much more in life constantly. External sources of happiness is what creates happiness for others and I think this is what drives Americans to be so power hungry and determined to accomplish new things constantly. I believe the poor people from the movie tend to find happiness easier because they are content with the things life has to offer them, not needing money to find joy but instead to survive. I do agree that the ultimate formula of happiness is play, new experiences, friends and family and that we must have meaningful and deep conversations. 
         	   <br><br>

I also agree that happiness is relatively simple in most parts, though life tends to make things for complex. I am a firm believer that happiness is found everywhere and in the smallest things. Happiness is when a stranger does something nice for you and we should take more time to recognize the smaller things but I do see what you mean when you say the movie has a little bit of bias.

I too was very interested in the happiness survey presented near the beginning of the film, and was surprised to hear that they reported only 10% of a person's happiness is due to money and status. While we often hear that these things do not make us happy, I certainly did not expect the figure to be so low. However, as the film progressed many stories were told of people who found happiness from the internal sources that you mention. These stories were a great way of concretely showing that the internal sources of happiness, not the external search for money or status, were what were truly crucial to living a happier life
          	   <br><br>

For example, the film gives an example of an a man who was a former banker, but now volunteered in a Home for the Dying and Destitute in Kolkata, India. Despite living a much less luxurious and expensive lifestyle than before, the man seems to find true happiness working at the home because of the care and love that he is able to provide for those who have been forgotten. To me, this was a true example of someone who was able to find real happiness away from the pursuit for money and status that many people find themselves in. My hope is that more people in the U.S. can realize this truth soon, so that overall happiness in our country can continue to grow and improve.



<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your response!  In today's society, many individuals are concerned about gaining happiness from external sources. I've seen firsthand from myself as well as my peers that we often get lost in gaining status and wealth. This is because we believe that these things will make us happy. However, the truth is that material items only provide short term happiness. The movie, "Happy" does an excellent job of providing statistical evidence to support their claims. It may have been a bit one-sided, but ultimately it brought to light what we've all been thinking. I especially agree with your comment regarding happiness and how its irrespective or class, race, and age. Personal growth and building relationships are factors of internal happiness that ARE longer lasting. My dad used to say to me: "when you're at your deathbed, you're not going to think about money or status. You'll be thinking about the people you have around you and your personal growth" as you have also stated. Therefore, I think this quote applies to this movie, and has changed a lot of my perspectives on life.

I have heard in the past the idea that a person doesn’t get happier after making a certain amount of money and having all their basic needs met. I never really believed in this because growing up I always wanted to have a job that would give me the best income so I could make my parents proud. But, since I came to college, I have realized the importance of doing things that actually make me happy and consequently finding a job that will actually make me happy and something that I am passionate about. Seeing the different people around the world that are either living happier or sadder and more stressed lives was very eye-opening. I was very intrigued by how Japan was the least happy of the developed nations because of their extremely long work hours and the amount of deaths from jobs, yet there was the island of Okinawa that had the most elderly people per capita in the world. Happy people tend to live longer and healthier lives so seeing that Okinawa had so many elderly people was very interesting to me. The woman who was being interviewed first from Okinawa looked so happy and vibrant and I would never have guessed her to be 106 years old!

I think the issue that truly isolates and hurts us Americans is our desire for the American Dream over happiness. We put our extrinsic goals above intrinsic ones and focus on finding whatever job that makes the most money or to go to the school with the highest status rather than work in what we love and go to school where we feel most connected. So many students end up in colleges where they feel so depressed, anxious, and lonely because the school doesn’t fit who they are or what their needs are, but they go there because it has the best reputation. Although this makes sense in our eyes, I don’t think it should make sense. We have created a world where all we care about is our extrinsic goals, but this shouldn’t be the case. In other countries, people aren’t as stressed about going to college right after high school or working in a top corporation. They take time to travel around the world and gain experiences culturally and mentally. This is a major issue that has caused us Americans and other people to be less happy than we should be.

Watching the film "Happy" showed me that the wealthy aren't always happy or satisfied and that people who are poor found happiness in other ways. A poor Indian man in the beginning says “I feel that I am not poor, but I am the richest person” simply from surrounding himself with people he loves. I've heard the saying that money does not buy happiness but I always had a doubt about that. But after watching a handful of people telling their stories of how they found happiness, including the woman who was run over by a truck which caused her to go through surgeries, go through a divorce after, and contemplate about suicide, it has turned my head. Another important point that the film made was that only 10% of happiness was due to external environment, which includes money, status, and so on. Another 40% is happiness where you can choose what you want to do.

This film was one of my favorites because it demonstrated how those who aren't the wealthiest are the happiest. I noticed what contributed to their happiness was a sense of community and the ability to surround themselves by those they love. I think it is important to stop and reflect on what our motives are. Whether they are intrinsic or extrinsic, we should really stop to analyze which ones truly make us happy. Like they mentioned in the film, there is a balance as to where money does buy happiness. If you earn to little  you face hardships, but if you are in the median range or wealthy your happiness is about the same. I think finding intrinsic motives will really help us to begin to change our American way of life.

Money really does not bring you happiness because it is limited it will be unable to buy its way into true emotions and real memories of happiness. According to Minister Dorji in the film, people can become surprisingly materialistic in terms of land to consumerism controlled by the government in order to satisfy the people. Denmark has free education plus co-ed housing which sounds really good, but I feel like the more simplicity there is the happier someone would appreciate the things they take for granted. There are truly many concepts of obtaining happiness through materialism to kindness being the most effective. Happiness is temporary however the memories we make in relationships last longer because we as humans live our entire lives feeling something. During my time volunteering, I put myself out there at places such as Food Not Bombs and Your Children’s Trees and I learnt that through new friendships that I made I sought out happiness through acts of selfless kindness.

Are we destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness?
          	   <br><br>
 I agree that people are destroying the plant by the guidance of pursuit of happiness. I would like to categorize happiness into two groups: short-term happiness and long-term happiness. There are many choices for the public that some of them are misguiding consumers as the exchange of higher profit for companies. This is the reason why more and more companies are seeking social responsibilities to better serve the planet (of course, consumers have greater awareness about environment and sustainability and companies want to create better brand images). Short-term happiness more likely related indulgence and consumption, thus, people embrace fast-fashion immediately when it exists. There are not so much responsibilities for consumers to worry. But long-term happiness will need a wider and more profound vision to make decisions. A large group of consumers are spoiled by brands (Customer is your God philosophy). Based on personal perspective, I think there is no right or wrong of short-term and long-term happiness but better choice. I hope consumers could act more as supervisors to monitor brands to conduct better and more responsible acts to the climate.

Happiness is simply. It does not need you to have a lot of money and achievements. Happiness is everywhere around us. It’s the smile on your family and friends’ faces, it’s the people you love who love you back, and it’s the nature you care about nurtures you for years and years. 
          	   <br><br>
It’s the nature who raise us, so for sure, we human beings are connected to nature just like other species on the planet. There are some episodes in the documentary that impressed me. A Brazilian man who likes surfing living in a comparatively simple home goes to the sea almost every day. He says that “surfing is a religion to me, and I am happy when I am in the water.” I was moved by the moment when he and his son are surfing on the sea waves. They are like the water spirits following the movement of the sea waves, beautifully and hormonally.

Nowadays, the chemicals from the factories are dumped into the rivers, the pesticides are ruining the croplands, and the plastic garbage forcibly occupies the ocean. The value of people today is misguiding. They pursue happiness by harming nature intentionally or unintentionally, and that’s contradictory to the heavenly principles. Only when the environment is in good condition, the people will live healthily and happily. Otherwise, human’s fate will be just like the polar bears. Thousand years earlier, the arctic pole was covered in heavy ice and the polar bears are the king of the place. However, the temperature is rising due to the emission of NO2 and the ice was melted a lot by now. The number of polar bears is tremendously decreasing and they are facing the danger of dying out. 
          	   <br><br>
We should stop keeping the sick value of pursuing fake happiness by destroying our environment. As the researchers in the documentary mention: Money and success are only 10 percent of the source of our happiness. People gain more happiness if they care about the things that bigger than themselves, for example, to care about nature and make it a better place.
          	   <br><br>
We should embrace our mother nature rather than hurt her, again and again. I remember when I was little, my father took me to a reed field. He took me in his arms and let my little feet swing on the top of the reeds. We were laughing peacefully and happily. I really miss those days, and I really hope that was not our last happy scene with nature.

I believe that we are destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness because from the birth of the United States people have been made to think that a person's wealth is measured by what kind of stuff you have as well as having a lot of stuff. We are not a very happy country even though the pursuit of happiness is embedded in our constitution. This tireless pursuit of happiness in the United States is significantly hurting our planet when it shouldn’t. I do believe that we can become happier if we make similar changes to that of other developed countries who are happier than the United States. Some of these things are like universal healthcare, educating girls and women, implementing laws and infrastructure and by shifting our economy away from fossil fuels. In the film, they show many different people for many cultures and many socioeconomic backgrounds who are happier than some wealthy people. Happiness is not measured by the stuff you have even though that has become the practice in the United States. I was shocked to learn that the average income of 75,000 dollars correlated to the peak average happiness in the United States. That just goes to show that you do not need to be insanely wealthy to be really happy in the US. The documentary “Happy” was one that I enjoyed very much because I connected the most with its message. Personally, I feel like a lot of stuff equates to messy which equates to stress which in the end does not make me happy. If more people connected with that than we could help the climate crisis because the waste from our stuff hurts our planet and releases unnecessary CO2 into the atmosphere. We need a culture shift in America, people need to become more climate-conscious and by buying less and by choosing to buy from companies that have climate and socially just practices.

While we have had some assigned readings or films that evoked optimism rather than stress for our current climate situation, the film "Happy" had me the most positive and significantly more smiling throughout the viewing. Rather than alarming that the consumer culture is overtaking us and that we struggle with equivocating things like wealth to happiness/success, it celebrated the concept that happiness is truly what you make of it; everyone encounters adversity but because of the way they respond to it they are able to view the situation differently. The nature and resilience of the people featured in the film were truly inspiring, highlighting an important attitude we should all have in life. I never knew that you begin losing dopamine synapses the more you age. Facts like this in the film further underscored how much we need to stop getting lost in things that truly do not matter and are not as bad as we might think it is in hindsight. Finding appreciation for bigger things and being compassionate is far more important than dwelling on the less fortunate occurrences in life and turning to bitterness/ungratefulness. It isn’t always easy to bounce back, but seeing people in the film exhibit such behavior like Melissa Moody and Roy Blanchard exemplify an admirable attitude that I hope I am able to take on and maintain up until my very last days. It is also this attitude that we should be striving to apply to bigger problems such as the climate crisis. Being compassionate is important in doing what is important and necessary for our planet, and while we have done things that have had detrimental effects on the planet we should still be able to look at the crisis in a hopeful, encouraging light.

I too was shocked at how our potential happiness essentially decreases as we age. It kinda sparked a light-bulb in my head and explained the whole, "children are the joy of the world" or "happy as a child" and even the classic angry grandpa "get off my lawn" and "bitter old men" expressions. I guess it makes sense, statistically children are happier because they are hard wired to be happy and have not had a chance to incur in any negative practices to change that yet. This in turn made me reflect on my own practices. I too want to grow old and be happy throughout my life, but compared to the elders of Okinawa some of my practices are straight up contradictory to theirs. I have always thought of sleep as something nice, but optional. Essentially, sleep for me was what I do when I am done with all my school work and spent all the time I wanted to hanging out with my friends. It does't matter If I sleep 5 or 4 hours a night. My motto was part of the whole you get to pick 2 out of sleep, social life and grades shpeel where I picked the last 2. Moving forward and taking into consideration all that was presented in the film, I will make sure to balance my classes accordingly for the following years. Given that I am almost 19 and according to the film dopamine receptors start declining around 20 years old, I want to ensure that I establish healthy practices that enable me to be the happiest I can be.

I completely and wholeheartedly agree with your impeccable analysis of the movie “happy”. like you said, the positivity that the film conveyed towards overcoming adversity is the mentality everyone should have and is the mentality that I aspire to have until the day I die. Bad things happen to everyone, family members get ill, friends lose their way, and career setbacks happen, however if you can approach these events with a sense of optimism and not nihilism, your time on this planet will be much better.

One thing I liked about this movie is the fact that it discussed the things that truly make the individual happy. Unlike other movies that have mentioned the futility of America's consumer culture, this movie had a more in depth look into what actually makes you happy. I like how this movie emphasized not to chase money but instead relationships and work that will be fulfilling.

The overall message that was communicated in the film, "Happy" was that happiness can not be achieved through materialistic accomplishments. They portrayed this through the use of multiple anecdotes throughout the film as well as statistical evidence. Until I watched this film I never knew that fifty percent of happiness is dependent on genetics, ten percent on income, and forty percent on your actions. After hearing the story of the lady and her car accident, seeing how she dealt with her responsibilities as a mother despite her husband leaving her and not giving in to the temptation of committing suicide after her copious surgeries and come out on the other side with a great husband and a job she enjoys was inspiring. I realized that I spend so much of my day working hard on school work so that I can obtain a well-paying job in the future instead of paying more attention to my happiness on a day to day basis. This film helped me put things into perspective and allowed me to realize that happiness is only ten percent dependent on income so they shouldn’t let it take over ninety percent of our lives.

Through this family I learned about life and standards of happiness in other parts of the world. I learned that as you get older the dopamine receptors in your brain decrease. The reason that physical activity feels so good is because it releases dopamine, making you happier. I learned that hedonic adaptation is when we return to a relatively stable level of happiness after a good or bad event. This movie used the Japanese desire for money as an example of humanity needing to change their goal from being increasing their wealth to increase their happiness. In Japan, people are working themselves to death, and they have even created a word for it, Karoshi. I found out that Denmark is one of the happiest countries in the world. They have free education up to college, as well as nationwide healthcare. In Denmark, multiple families live in large joined buildings where they share the space and essentially become a family. In some places they believe in finding each other’s company as a fundamental to being happy, so instead of placing one body into a coffin they cremate multiple bodies and put all of their ashes into one coffin.

I believe that since the American dream is based off of obtaining the biggest house and the most comfortable car that we believe we can buy our way to happiness and that simply is not true. We are merely buying things in hope that it brings us some kind of fulfillment but it actually just leads to more carbon emissions being released into our already carbon filled atmosphere.

The whole notion of the “American Dream” that has been perpetuated for decades is a facade and an outdated ideal. America has irrevocably tied happiness and materialism together through shameless advertising and consumerism. Relying on superficial material goods as a source of happiness will never bring anyone the same sense of fulfillment as the important things in life - family, friends, and your passions. Proving this, it is amazing to see how people from other countries, who have less material goods than Americans or may be living in poverty, seem more genuinely happy than the average American because they focus on values other than consumerism. Contrarily, it seems as though American society forces people to keep wanting more and more things and brainwashing society into believing that acquiring these meaningless products will make them happy or successful. Ken is correct in saying that no matter how much we have, it still doesn’t feel like enough. This toxic consumerism isn’t just an American trait; Japan also struggles with extremely low levels of happiness due to an exhausted and overworked workforce. Astonishingly, they’ve even coined a term resulting in the high amount of deaths resulting from being overworked: Karoshi. These types of lifestyles are completely inhumane and unsustainably. Countries everywhere should be striving to create happier societies instead of turning their citizens into sleep-deprived, overworked machines. Denmark, on the other hand, is an example of a country we should all look towards as the ideal, as they have one of the happiest populations in the world. This all ties back to how our lifestyles are negatively impacting our planet. Under severe capitalism, societies tend to be unhappier and are linked to producing more carbon emissions because of the wasteful tendencies they are used to having. Denmark, a democratic socialist country, has happier citizens overall and are one of the leading countries in implementing sustainable measures throughout their society because they aren’t driven by capitalism and profit.

Since I was young my parents have always told me that money does not buy happiness. I feel like money holds so much power in America and it is because of this that people think the more money you have, the happier you will be. However, this is not the case. Also, in order to earn this money you have to work and do a lot of things that usually have a high potential of harming this planet. Once they earn their money, people tend to spend it on luxury/materialistic items. They believe that if they fill their life with enough "stuff" that they will be happy. Look at the Kardashians as an example. The Kardashians have every luxury you could imagine along with an absurd amount of money and they seem perfectly happy. That is because the media only shows you what they want you to see, which is their perfect life (along with the occasional scandal). To Americans, that is what the American Dream is. To have whatever you want. It is this mindset that has been killing our planet. All of this stuff that we fill our lives with is unnecessary and it adds to the climate crisis. Americans need to start considering what is actually meaningful to them and their lives and forget about the "American Dream" altogether.

I used to think for a long time that money did buy happiness. If you want a place to live, to support your family, and to live comfortably, you need money. Beyond the materialistic use of money to buy personal goods and luxuries, it's undeniably that money is a necessity to live. Without it, society pushes you out to live in the streets and fend for yourself. You're absolutely correct, money holds so much power in America, and we are raised our entire lives with the impression that money is the only thing we live for. We go to school to get a job so we can earn money. We work day after day after day for money, when in reality it's only a slip of paper dyed green. We're so wrapped up in trying to get these slips of paper so we can exchange it for the right to live in a house and eat on a table. If we really cared about the happiness, security, and well being of people in this world, we wouldn't force them to undergo physical labor for their entire lives to earn the only thing in this society that we can use to obtain the necessary components of living. 

<br><br>
It's the desire for money that led to the destruction of our planet, and it continues to do so. The only reason people industrialized the meat industry, burned down entire forests,  and created this system that exploits the working class is to make themselves rich. Money is such a dehumanizing thing that it has led us to destroy the only planet we have without a second thought. The only way we can ever hope to salvage what we have left is to take a hard look at our way of live and evoke change to fix it before it's too late.

Similar to you, my parents also always told me that money does not buy happiness. I, like many others, did not believe them. I always thought that if I was rich, famous, and had material success I would be able to be happy. However, after watching this film and seeing examples of "successful" people being unhappy, I think my definition of happiness has changed. As you mention, I realized that it is important to consider the meaningful things in life. If people can draw happiness out of the meaningful things in life such as spending time with family and friends and doing hobbies that you like, then being happy will be much easier.

Ken was right - watching Happy again was even better the second time. The rickshaw driver at the beginning of the movie really put everything into perspective right away since most of us watching are in much more privileged positions than him. It made me feel that I should have never complained about anything in my life, but when I thought about it, rather than not complaining it’s more so about focusing on gratitude for what is in front of us and actively trying to get out of the mindset of lack. When we think of everything we don’t have, our minds think that we are deficient and need something else to feel happy. In actuality, we have so much to be happy about when we simply shift our mindset. As the doctors in the film outlined, 50% of our happiness is attributed to genes, 40% is our intentional activity, and only 10% is our circumstances (income, social status, etc.). This breakdown is telling in the sense that everything we’ve ever heard in the media and in society in general, tells us the opposite. It feels like instead of 10% it would be more like 60%. Advertisements, music, movies, and everything we see tells us that we need to achieve a certain goal whether that be in terms of status or materialism, but only once we get there are we allowed to be happy. In modern society, it’s like we have to actively work against the system to be happy and content. 
<br><br>
I’ve heard of some mothers feeling lonely and depressed after having kids and being alone with them all the time, so the cohousing alternative where the mother in Denmark lives is the perfect solution. Not only does she get to socialize and form bonds with other adults, but her kids have other kids to play with. The way the families take turns on who cooks dinner and does the chores is a great system that highlights doing something good to benefit a collective rather than just yourself. It reminds me of this quote I’ve heard, “thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle and the life of the candle will not be shortened; happiness never decreases from being shared.” I love this idea because it’s so true. Every time I share anything with others, it makes me feel satisfied and happy to do so.

As mentioned in Happy, I feel as if the statistic that in the US, Americans have multiplied their income by 2 in the last 50 years, but their happiness remains the same is extremely relevant to traditional idea of the American Dream which subconsciously controls the decisions we make in our lives and how we advise other to lead their lives. Being extremely wealthy in the American way: big house, more than one car, white picket fence, golden retriever etc is no longer sustainable, if it ever was. We have turned this vision into something seemingly unachievable, we can never have enough. We always have to make something bigger and better to show that we have achieved the dream. People are working 40+ hours a week to fulfill this ideal, but being forced to spend most of their paychecks on rent and food, hoping that one day the system will benefit them. On the other hand, there are people have more money than they know what to do with, like the Kardashians for example, who contribute little to nothing in our society with all this money piling up in their banks, and what the funniest part is all is that the people who work these hours LOVE people like Kylie or Kim, they willingly buy into their image, purchase their products and propel this gap even further apart. We need to stop idolizing these people who represent this nearly impossible American Dream, because we will not be fulfilled once we get there. If what is said in this film and what Ken says is true, and we truly aren’t happier past $75,000 a year, then we need to start prioritizing a different kind of American Dream, where we are satiated by real things rather than materialism, as it is evident that this dream is ruining our planet. What was great about the film is how they showed different countries around the world, such as Bhutan, which are not nearly as wealthy as the U.S. being the happiest country in Asia. I have also seen this from personal experience, as I visit my family in Brazil every year, and though there are very well off parts of the country there is also a lot of poverty. Regardless, the family friends I have there that are less fortunate are always in the best spirits and extremely positive people. Every time I see these people in my life, it reminds me to have a more positive outlook on life as they don’t have all the resources and things that I have or that my family has there and yet they are out here, living their lives to the fullest. The importance of culture and social interaction with one another that is super prevalent in Brazilian society is a great example as how we can shift our culture to normalizing social interactions with each other as this will create a better support system in our communities and have people be more inclined to work together. It’s crazy to me, because many Americans don’t know their neighbors at all, don’t talk to them and they live their entire lives in their bubble of work and few friends. There is no connection to the environment around them and the people it affects, if we can change that by literally just making friends and seeing the good in people as an actual quality instead of living our lives for monetary value, then maybe we will be able to truly see the worth of keeping this planet alive. As mentioned in the wrap up video Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet, if all those changes are enforced and sought after by the general public, and we motivate each other to try and create a sustainable planet, chasing after a more meaningful goal, things may be better for all.

I think that "Happy" isn't so much about giving us the step-by-step as to what we should do to find happiness, but it's more like giving us a sense of what we can do on our own personalized level. We need to stop putting ourselves through this everlasting pursuit of happiness, which for an American would probably equal to the American Dream. 10% of our happiness comes from material stuff, while 90% is a mixture of our genetics and what we control. 90% is basically us, and we have control over our happiness. What I'm getting from this is that we need to find happiness in what we have and stop focusing on what we don't. So yeah, to a certain extent we're destroying our planet in our pursuit of happiness, but I wouldn't say it's truly misguided because happiness really is subjective and differs from person to person. But the American Dream and its idea that bigger is better and more is better leads to overconsumption and way too much emission. The line between overconsumption and happiness is so blurred for us, and we just can never find happiness from what we consume, so we just keep going because we feel that the only way to fill that void and find that satiation point is to consume increasing amounts every time.

I really enjoyed watching this film because it relates to what we all look for in life: happiness. Many people believe that success means great wealth, high social status, etc are things that will essentially bring happiness. However, as seen on the film, that only accounts for ten percent of one’s happiness. Most people who claimed they were happy were those living in extreme poverty. They had very little materialistic items to offer, but so much happiness to share. It’s very important young adults watch this film as they commence going out into the real world. We go out into the workforce in hopes of finding success and happiness in materialistic things. However, this film gives a great sense of hope that we don’t need to make lots of money to buy things and find happiness, we must find that within ourselves.

Happiness in America is different than other countries. The American Dream is what people strive for. The American Dream is essentially having a lot of money and having a family. However, you find that most happy people are people who do not have a lot. I do not remember the specific study but it is said that the less you have, the more likely you are to be happy. I think being owning so many products can lead to stress because you are always searching for something better.


<br><Hr>
I completely agree with your statement regarding the importance of showing our youth that happiness can be derived from more than just materialistic items and possessions. Showing a happy life whilst living an earth friendly and eco-friendly lifestyle is simply crucial in these times of battling climate crisis. It's ironic when people believe that happiness comes from fancy cars, designer clothes, etc. when in reality, it really just provides temporary happiness and slowly but surely develops long-term sadness because you never feel as though you have enough to prove your social status. It's all so unnecessary too. At the end of the day, people won't remember what car or make of a car you drive, or what clothes you wear. So why destroy the earth while buying these obnoxious and unnecessary items? We need to take immediate action and provide more examples of how a happy life can be achieved by much simpler things in life. For the sake of the earth, ourselves, and our future children.

If a person can make 32k a year, he is the top 1 percent in the world based the rank of revenue. 32k is even less than tuition of a ucsb undergraduates student without scholarship per year. Thus, for the rest of 99 percent, more money represents more happiness. One of the most common ways to convert money to happiness is through the consuming. Through consuming, life can be more comfortable, convenient, and safe. This is what everybody pursues. Only when people have it, or had it before may pursue something further or metaphysics. Unfortunately, the rest 99 percent of people increasingly release CO2.
 <br><br>

Yeah a poor person can be happy and a rich person can be unhappy. However, if the poor person who can not drink clean water becomes a person who can take a hot shower everyday, he does not want to become poor anymore. If taking away the money of a rich person who said he is not happy and sending his to the poor, he will be even more unhappy. Thus, money is not the problem. For most people who do not have a consistent faith, money is the thing to improve the happiness

This film tackles the bigger question in life: how do achieve happiness? American society wants us to believe hat the answer to that question is through consumerism, wealth, and materialistic items. Shows MTV "Cribs" series portrays on to society that by achieving a big a mansion with millions of dollars in your bank account is the true happiness in life. However, the film "Happy" proves to us that even the poorest of people are truly the happiest. With 50% of happiness is decided by our genes, 40% decided by our daily actions and only 10% is based on wealth, status and employment. In the film, they mention how dopamine is a chemical in the brain called a neurotransmitter that is necessary for feeling of pleasure and happiness: electrical impulses comes down a nerve they hit a connection, the connection releases chemicals, the chemicals diffuse to the next nerve cell, they bind to receptors on the next nerve cell and they cause an electrical changes this is a neurotransmitter. As you age you slowly lose dopamine, so one must seek out experiences to keep dopamine in their system (and remain happy) through exercise or any from of activity. I found this information incredible as to how scientist can calculate or find happiness in people's genes. 
 <br><br>
I also enjoyed the stories of people from all around the world who live in what American society would think as poverty or rural, but these people are living happier lives than we are. Such as Manoj Singh from Kolkata slums in India, who works all day under the hot sun or rain (depending on the weather of the day) carrying abusive customers on his rickshaw yet when coming home to his little shack and seeing the faces of his kids he feels as though he was the richest man in the world. The film also touched on the idea of "in the zone" happiness where people seem to just get lost in a certain activity without realizing and can only feel happiness. I can connect with this idea as my "in the zone" happiness is every time I go on the soccer field and practice or play a game because every time I am running with the ball at my feet I forget about my school work, family troubles, or things I need to do. All I focus on is getting the ball inside the net and every time I do, Im truly happy.

I think this film connects to the idea we talked about in class-- minimalism.It is true that with the fast growth of economy especially in the developed countries such as U.S, many people are getting good job opportunities and are earning more and more money. We can spend money on buying things we love since we have all the good products that we are available on the market, ,and we can buy anything we love to eat. This seems to be a good thing as everyone are actually happy. 

 <br><br>

      However, this makes me think of the reading we read in class, Waldens. I really like how in the reading it says when people in developed places are aiming to pursuit money and happiness, they spend most of their life time only working and thinking how to make more money and buy all the things they want. Money makes them happy but actually they are not getting really happiness, for example, their health is worsening and they get less time to do other things they truly enjoy. 

 <br><br>

     This connects to the topic we have been discussing in class about climate changes and happiness. When we talk about happiness, we only care about the current moment and the idea about whether we have enough wealth. We often forget that with this kind of consumption pattern and lifestyle, we are causing so much pollution on this planet we are living and making it an unsustainable one. Not only for ourselves but for our future generations. So I think we all need to rethink our style of living connects to the idea of global warming. Are we all truly happy?Did we forget about the tragedy that we can leave to our kids and grandchildrens by all the things we are doing?(Yes, we did). So that's why it's time we all should awake and rethink the true meaning of happiness. To find a way which we can enjoy our happy lives but also make our planet a happy places for the others and the future people to live on.

Happiness is interpretative. There is no one definition but having good people in your life can be a part of it. Watching the documentary, there was an emphasis that being happy is not about money and popularity; studies have shown that people who are happy usually have close friends and family. It was cool that they put different people and included a small part of their life to show what makes them happy. Even though this film did not have much to do with the climate crisis, I think it really documents part of the purpose of this class. It creates awareness that happiness does not come from materialistic values, but from building close communities and having tight-knit circles. There was a focus on interaction with good people and doing things you love rather than centering your attention on money-oriented things. To discuss happiness, regarding money, they asked the audience to look between someone with no home and someone else with a mansion, while money can bring happiness, it is only to a certain extent. The idea was that if you have the basic necessities, then relationships and community comes next. Pursuing happiness is an inherent purpose for humans but we look for it in the wrong ways. Consumer culture is heavily-ingrained in America, and with a growing technological era, it is getting worse. Because of social media and an entertainment industry that caters to luxury and class, people assume that they can also attain that same happiness by looking for it in fame and riches. This documentary, however, depicts the reality that people deny themselves. Interaction and living a meaningful life is very important in being happy. Because despite human's inherent want for happiness, we also need to interact with people to survive. Social media has made that harder and while it can still be a cool platform, I think people end up forgetting the whole point of it: keeping in touch with loved ones, seeing what people are up to and so on. 
 <br><br>

So yes, I do think we are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness. The media is influenced by an unattainable standard of perfectionism. Through films, television shows, the internet, and a culture that revolves around these,  it's hard to not become confined by its misguided message. This film really did a great job of breaking away from what can be a toxic culture to prioritize the necessity of friends and family. And with the climate crisis very present, I think we need to watch this film and take its message very seriously. Because by doing so, not only can we be on a good path for happiness but we may help the planet as well.

A strong sense of community, above all else, would make Americans happier while being able to lower their climate footprint. Community means being able to confidently share certain resources in close proximity in a social way, lighting off the dopamine in our brains while reducing the CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. While the many comforts that the average American lifestyle, complete with all the consumer goods, space, and food one could want sounds like the key to happiness on paper, the reality is that all of these extra things do little once basic needs have been met. This is why democratic socialist governments seem to be more effective at promoting happiness: they already provide the basic needs to the common people, empowering them to pursue happiness instead of leaving many to crawl from the bottom of a perilous ladder. 

 <br><br>

The sense of declined community in the US is very strong: many organizations that used to be bastions of community involvement are now seeing record low attendance. There are a multitude of reasons for this. Modern consumer culture promotes having your own things. When applied to nearly every consumer good, especially ones that don't require this sort of ownership and wasteful items (like cars), our climate footprint multiplies. This leaves out space for shared resources. This might mean shared kitchen equipment as in the co-housing communities of Denmark in the film, as well as all the other shared facilities that go along with it. The increased reliance on social media for entertainment as opposed to local clubs, organizations, etc, also reduce our happiness (since we're not actually with people) and increase our climate footprint (increased reliance on fossil fuel powered devices). Our main mode of transportation, cars are thoroughly anti-social. We sit, usually alone, in metal cages where our only real means of communication is usually short and aggressive (honking horns, flipping people off). On the other hand, walking and bicycling naturally encourage more social interactions. I very often wave to other cyclists on the road and sometimes even have nice chats with total strangers, which is something very rare but perhaps very valuable today. 
 <br><br>


With this in mind, it becomes abundantly clear how much of a cultural issue that climate change really is. If our culture shifted to be more oriented towards the community instead of the self, then many of our most anti-social, selfish practices that are also destructive to the environment just wouldn't make sense. The moment that struck me the hardest in the film was the section on karoshi. Seeing the little girl, Ami, who barely saw her father due to his work obligations broke my heart. In other countries, they give some 400-500 or so days for paid leave between the parents. In Japan, on the other hand, the culture that insists on relentless work ethic above all else literally works their population to death. We become more productive (especially in the US), but for what? Studies show that we barely get paid more for this additional productivity. Instead, it goes straight to the top. We benefit not ourselves or our community with the working conditions we suffer, but instead an infinitesimal oligarchy.

"Happy" was an interesting documentary which is not necessarily be a film on environmentalism but nonetheless can be applied to the climate crisis through an interdisciplinary approach. One main takeaway from the film is that happiness can mostly be attained through non material things. For example, many of the places that were visited were not wealthy countries, nor were the people. For example, the film begins in a Koltaka slum in India. Manoj Signh describes himself as poor but the richest person. This is seen again with Ronaldo Fadul, a surfer in Brazil and Andy Wimmer who works at the Home of the Dying and Destitute, who are not rich nor own many expensive material possessions. They are nonetheless happy and content with their lives.
 <br><br>

 One thing to note however was that in order for people to have a higher chance of being happy, their basic living necessities need to be met first. Ken mentioned that this would mean that the average American would need to have an annual income of 75k. However, one interesting thing is that after a certain amount of money that takes you out of burden, happiness levels off. This is because like what the film states, happiness is largely not attained through material wealth. The more people get, the more they want.  
 <br><br>

 One important thing that I learned in this film and video is that the most industrialized and wealthiest countries are not necessarily happy. For example, we see in Japan that many of the people are not happy. It was unfortunate to see that even a demand of money and emphasis on work from the government has even led to the death of Kenichi, who worked at Toyota. The government, like the film suggested and Ken did, play a large factor in determining one’s happiness.
 <br><br>

 Happiness is a priority of some governments, as the US emphasizes in their constitution that citizens are entitled to their own “pursuit of happiness.” However, which government prioritizes this? We see that in capitalist nations, the wellbeing and happiness of their people are not accounted for. In addition, from both the film and video I think that we need to take one thing in consideration however; the relative wealth of other countries. I think by simply looking at that the happiest countries in the world are Nordic countries without being critical, we overlook the government of poorer countries. We then assume that a Nordic “socialist” nation is better than a socialist nation in the global South.

Yes, I think so. The movie starts with a citation from Benjamin Franklin. He said that “the constitution only guarantees the American people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.” Then, this movie shows that many people want to be happy when asked what they want. This movie does a good job of explaining why we are not happy and how we can become happier. Although some people are poor living in bad conditions and earning little money, they are still happy. It states that about 50 percent of a person's happiness is inherently determined. That means only 10 percent of happiness can be influenced by circumstances and 40 percent will be changed by our intentional behavior.  So, people could choose how to be happy without a better environment. It is interesting to know that happiness has no direct relation with circumstance since I think happiness is from daily life. This movie is describing lives in different people’s worlds and how they feel about such life. From my perspective, I think happiness does not depend on material satisfaction and living circumstances. Instead, it is based on our self-satisfaction and self-identification.


<br><hr>
Thank you for your response!
  <br><br>

I also find it interesting that though there are people who lack resources and are poor, they are still nonetheless happier than the average person in a developed country. I think the Benjamin Franklin quote is interesting because the United States guarantees the American people to the right to pursue happiness in the constitution. Though Franklin says that you have to pursue it, I feel that this nation does not truly give people the opportunity to pursue happiness, there are many restrictions. For example, there is large socioeconomic stratification. Many people cannot afford basic necessities for living. As we saw in the film, you do not need money to be happy. However, you do need your basic living needs met. I believe that Ken said that the average American household would need to make at least 80k a year to have their needs met. After that, their happiness levels level off. However, this minimum household income is not made in every household in the United States. Therefore, I feel that Franklin’s quote is not accurate since the constitution is not guaranteeing the American people the right to pursue happiness in the first place. I think this is a land of not equal, but unequal opportunity.
  <br><br>

I think that the statistics in measuring our happiness is also interesting. For example, like you said, only 50% of a person’s happiness is genetically determined. This leaves us with 50% of our happiness being determined by our material conditions and actions. I think personally that it should be the responsibility of our government to address that, especially here in the U.S. where the government exploits a lot of its people. Yes 10% is influenced by circumstances, but the other 40% is determined by intentional behavior, which can be largely inhibited if you do not have your basic living needs met. Happiness levels may not necessarily be a life or death situation in many cases, however, people should be subject to a dignified life. 
  <br><br>

In a lot of the cases, we saw that many people are happy because of their mindset. I think that mindset is very important. However, I think the main question we should be asking is why is there an increasing amount of unhappy people, and why is it concentrated in certain areas. Nonetheless, I think the film was very interesting and I learned many things from it.

The film “Happy” makes a compelling argument that once basic necessities like food and shelter are provided for, economic factors have relatively little to do with overall satisfaction in life. With subjects ranging from an Indian rickshaw driver to a family of crab-fishing Cajuns in the Louisiana bayou to an aging Brazilian surfer, the film benefits from the huge variety of experiences it examines. People are happy and relaxing, even though they do not have a large amount of possession. However, in other parts of the world, some people are really busy at earning money, but they are probably not happy. Some of them lose their family, their children cannot recognize them because they did not see each other for a long time. Some people even lose their lives due to overwhelming work load. One example is the recent Japanese phenomenon known as “karoushi” (literally, “dying from overwork”). Citing scientific research that argues one’s health is directly related to his or her happiness, the filmmakers contrast the alarming work situation in many Japanese cities – where “karoushi” is being listed as the legal cause of death with more and more frequency – with another Japanese oddity: a disproportionate number of centenarians in rural areas, especially on the island of Okinawa. All in all, “Happy” works best as an introduction to the subject, and it presents its information in a clear and appealing way that often belies the sheer quantity of stuff being thrown on the screen – data and stories culled from five continents over a period of four years.

It was super cool to see that happiness does not directly correlate to wealth (except for the extremely impoverished) and that people living modest and exciting lifestyles often had the most freedom and happiness in their lives. The people they showed seemed very relaxed even if they were not successful according to the "American Dream" with a large house and expensive luxury items. It seems that they were doing something they found some type of joy in and were with people they cared about. Their lives were very eyeopening and changed my perspective on what success really was, and how it could not be measured purely my the amount of wealth they have. In regards to countries such as Japan, it is disheartening to see some citizens be overworked office workers in a society that believes more hours = more work, when in reality it is more hours that lead to sleep deprivation, depression, and less efficiency in quality of work. Although we are quick to say that the most technological advanced countries are the best, we often must consider what criteria we are basing it off of. Wealth and GDP can not speak solely for the quality of life one lives, and it was evident in this film.

I really liked the pie chart from the film that 50% of happiness comes from genetics, 10% from circumstances, and I think 40% from your actions. It just goes to prove that as everyone barrels forward to have more and consume more, they do not realize they are driven from influence of advertisement after advertisement and generational ideas that the only way to be happier is to have more. Really the greatest way people can have an effect on their own happiness is by changing their mindset, being grateful for what they have, and changing their actions. So I agree with your comment that people can be happy and relaxed without a great deal of possessions. Karoshi scared the hell out of me too, that people in Japan were literally working themselves to death. Happy was a great film that highlights people truly are misguided in their pursuits of happiness, and that if they just stopped to smell the roses they might breathe a little easier and stop worrying about what they get to have next.

<br><hr>
Seeing the part of the film where they showed those who are overworked felt very melancholic. The fact that there is even a term for dying from working so much in Japan and that it is more common than one would think had me wishing that we as a people would stop basing success off of how much pressure one could put themselves through in order to “contribute” or make money. Aside from what “Happy” shows us, I’ve seen in a few videos and shows how happy and content people who live quiet lives in the countryside are as opposed to those who are stressed with office jobs in the city. They usually have few material possessions but are so generous towards their community, and I feel like we could learn a lot from them.
<br><hr>
“Wealth and GDP cannot speak solely for the quality of life one lives” I totally agree with your opinion on that. After watching this film, I found out that most of the happiness that many people are currently perusing are not true happiness, instead, people were misguided. In the film, it shows that happiness can be found not only by owning tons of stuff, or having numerous luxuries, people can also find it even within the most modest and normal life. Just like people said, the happiest thing is inside the simplest thing. I believe that people were influenced by the consumerism that simply think having more stuff means earning more happiness, which lead to more problem like you mentioned in the comment, the over work issue. Under that circumstances, more work means more money, and that leads to more consumption and more “happiness”. However, just like others mentioned in the reply, happiness is depending on one’s actions. You cannot simply gain more happiness if you work hard. In the contrary, over working can lead to depression and other health issues.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the film “Happy” makes a compelling argument by showing the stories of lives from people in 5 different continents. It’s interesting that you bring up the point about karoushi and it’s a clearly devastating situation that these people presented in Happy have a clear solution to. The people in the film show the concept of flow - people who challenge themselves in complex and demanding physical activities are happier because they are able to reach a state of consciousness. Living in the moment and forgetting about their ego. Nothing else really matters. 
  <br><br>

I think it’s so difficult for us to accomplish this experience of flow because of the way our capitalistic, mass consumerism market is set up. I read an article from Business Insider that Japan attempted to mitigate the crisis of karoushi by allowing workers to leave at 3pm on the last Friday of each month. And it’s to no one’s surprise that it was not that successful. I mean that may save them a few hours a week, but it does not address the larger issue at hand: that these countries value economic profit and productivity over the wellbeing of its citizens because of our market and our value of GDP. We need a major shift in the paradigm and I hope more people watch Happy to truly understand this.

I found the film to be interesting in pointing out how little our environment can shape our happiness when it comes down to it. Given that 50% of our happiness comes from genetics and only 10% comes from how much money we have or the type of job one has, it’s shocking to see how much emphasis we place on that 10%. Not only are we focusing less on mental health in order to be happy, we are also stigmatizing it while people who participate in the accumulation of wealth are celebrated. We as a society need to develop a larger understanding and acceptance of the notion that material goods will not bring us happiness. 
  <br><br>
 It’s important to note that perhaps people would be healthier if there was a larger shift among communities for supporting mental health. Because while it is no longer stigmatized the way it was before, it is sometimes difficult for people to access medical help for their mental health, limiting them from reaching their full potential of happiness. As other countries, like Bhutan, shift the conversation to finding and maintaining happiness instead of placing pressure on other issues facing their community, the United States as a whole needs to switch to this sort of mentality as well. The notion of the “American Dream” in the twenty-first century is a goal that many set for themselves, but it is truly damaging to a person to try to reach a level of success that is no longer normal. People’s priorities for surviving have shifted and it is damaging to place the pressure of this ideal on new generations. Children growing up with this notion and people entering the workforce now how to deal with issues like debt, lack of housing, unaffordable healthcare, and food insecurity. The basic pillars for survival and stability are now things that people have to worry about, therefore, it is unrealistic and damaging to focus on the concept of the “American Dream”.

Like you, I was also drawn in by the film’s use of statistics. As you mentioned in your comment, the assertion that 50% of our happiness is based on genetics, circumstances account for 10%, and intentional activity comprises the other 40 is really interesting to me. After hearing this, I reflected on my own life and can certainly see the argument for these claims regarding happiness. Before watching this documentary, I had always considered circumstances to be the main component of happiness. For example, more money would lead to a better house which would lead to better circumstances which would lead to more happiness. However, I now see the argument of the film which is that our body adapts to the things that we do and that the choices we make are what determines our true happiness. 
  <br><br>
Tying into the second part of your comment, I agree that the notion of “The American Dream” is counterintuitive to the argument of this documentary. Happiness comes from a feeling of fulfillment through compassion and collaboration. These are strongly intrinsic goals and concepts, however, the American Dream is much more superficial and an extrinsic goal. Because of this, people always seem to be striving towards this unattainable sense of fulfillment. It is quite a shame that the majority of the country lives without being content with their circumstances. Capitalism has led to a fixation on competition in the economy and in different markets and I think in that sense, we have lost the true meaning of happiness. 
  <br><br>
The film emphasizes this by making its audience compare their current lifestyles to those of other communities such as Okinawa, Bhutan, or Denmark. These communities have a more humanistic and connected approach to living, they are not striving towards happiness, instead, they are finding it in living their own lives. The film challenges us to find this same human connection in our own lives and I feel that this is especially important in light of the climate crisis. Because as we strive towards this American Dream, we lose more than just our happiness, we are also losing precious environmental resources at the same time.

As opposed to Ken's argument, as well as the documentary, I don't think we should ever want to be in a constant state of happiness. It's true, I do not think that you can be happy with very little things, but I think you can be happy if you like what you have and nothing more. Although this seems like a good idea and it should be where everyone strives to be, but to me, this is a death sentence for progress. Japan proved this the most, as shown in the documentary, about how they were able to rapidly industrialize even after getting two nukes dropped on them, and how the result upon this progress is envied by most western nations. Unfortunately, Japanese workers work themselves to near death, but this just shows how determined they are to make themselves better, to make their country better. I think the reason why we Americans are placed 19th on the global happiness scale is that we are hungry for progress, constantly wanting more. If everyone is happy with what they have, why bother to try to find a good job, or to go to college, when you can just work at a fast-food restaurant for minimum wage, live as a bachelor,...etc. Sure, you may be happier like that because you have no responsibilities, no deadlines or expectations; but your life would not have contributed anything back to the earth. Sure, we are probably more depressed than a lot of other countries, but we get things done. We too were just a young country, only being established a little more than 200 years ago, yet now we are a world superpower.  We most likely have gained this much power by taking from others, so now it is our responsibility to give back, and I don't think we should ever be happy until the rest of the earth is well and healthy.

In the movie “Happy,” scientists showed not so shockingly results of their study on materialism. The average person who depends on materialistic objects for their happiness are, in fact, less "happy" than those who have less. This just demonstrates the values we, as Americans, have set on ourselves. We need to shift from this detrimental lifestyle to something more beneficial, for example, more intrinsic values.

“Happy” is a film that talks about why people have happiness and what can make them happy. Happiness is the result of chemical reactions of dopamine which occurred in peoples’ brains. As people getting older, they will gradually lose dopamine which released naturally. As a result, they must find out the activities they are interested thus help the release of dopamine. By doing this, people can not only receive pleasure but also prevent mental diseases such as depression from happening. Unlike the peoples’ traditional idea of the causes of happiness, which is money or social status, it is created by personal growth, closed relationships, desire to help others and other intrinsic goals which are mentioned in the movie. This conclusion is effectively supported by the research that in the recent fifty years, although the economy of the United States grew a lot, the average happiness levels of Americans are pretty much staying the same or even declined a little bit as before.
  <br><br>

Nowadays, many people linked their happiness with the word “consume” closely. However, according to the Hedonic Adaption, no matter how much wealth or materials people possess, they always want more. The real happiness comes from compassion, kindness, cooperation rather than the extrinsic goals like money, image or status. Like Ken mentioned in his lecture, according to the list of happiness, the top five happiest countries: Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Netherland, have only half of the individual emissions of America. We should consider stopping the actions of consuming which definitely not make us happier but absolutely damaged our environment and triggered the climate crisis.

I totally agree that in today's society the word consume is often related to the word happiness, since the materialistic values that society holds are still dominating to this day. Time and time again, history has proven money to be a central idea that has divided peoples and caused violence. Even from the times of kings and queens, only royalty would enjoy life due to the money, and the people of that kingdom would be poor and spiteful of their lives due to a lack of money. If money was no longer an issue for everyone, then there is no significant distinguishing factor between a king and a peasant farmer other than title. This same idea can be applied today, where money is often one of the only separators between the upper class and middle-lower class Americans, meaning that if we instead focused on happiness and not money, society as a whole would be closer together. The American dream of being able to buy whatever you want and setting no limits on yourself is a thing of the past, and if America doesn't change this idea soon, it won't end well. In this presidential race alone, one candidate Andrew Yang focused on the idea of a "Humanity-First Economy" where social programs would be in place to allow people to pay for their basic needs, and the focus would instead be on finding meaningful work and re-imagining the entire idea of success entirely. While he unfortunately had to suspend his campaign, his ideas were definitely heard and I hope that they will be discussed going forwards in our politics. This also ties into the idea of flow being mentioned in the film, where meaningful work and actions were what keeps people motivated, not any external factor like money. Once money is no longer an issue, the true idea of "happiness" comes to light and most people are often found doing something completely unrelated to what they do to earn a living. Our entire society as a whole needs to start valuing happiness as a form of currency, and the American Dream, or any dream, should be the pursuit of happiness. This ties into the environmental debate since most people need to aim for happiness rather than the faux-happiness that comes with materialism.

I think you summarized the key points of the film very well here and I could not agree more with your own point at the end of the comment. I think it is also important to consider our cultural values and societal norms. I took a social psychology course a couple years back and we studied a few research studies that looked at social differences in "individualistic" cultures versus "group-centered" cultures. Of course, the United States is an individualistic culture and I come from a lower-middle class area, so I see how others value extrinsic goals as a measure of success and I was definitely like that too before coming to college. Now I'm not saying college is group-centered, in fact, I think UCSB is super competitive for no reason sometimes (like bio classes being designed to weed students out), but I have seen both sides in this environment. I also moved away from home which made me even more aware of my intrinsic goals. Of course extrinsic goals do make me happy still, but I think intrinsic goals make me more satisfied in life. 
  <br><br>
Bringing back these concepts to climate change, we can definitely make it an extrinsic goal by making carbon fees or something similar and then hopefully people would find it to be an intrinsic goal as well. But I think we need big cultural changes, specifically in the definitions of success and satisfaction, which I think are two of the biggest ways we measure happiness in the States.

I think that everyone may often ask themselves, after calming down, where is the meaning of my existence and what is the true meaning of life? For everyone (especially PhD students) who once questioned the sense of existence, this is a meaningful question: how can I feel happy? How can I feel the meaning of life, Don't lose hope? There are several impressive things in the movie: 1. Happiness depends on 50% of genes, 10% of social status / achievements, etc., 40% of what you do. 2. The response of happiness in the brain is the release of dopamine. If you don't release it for a long time, the tissue receiving dopamine will shrink, The extreme of this process is Parkinson's disease. In a sense, the brain is like a muscle. Happiness needs practice. 3. Exercise, or focus on something to bring happiness. 4. People imagine a good or bad thing to have a long-term and great impact on their lives. In fact, no good or bad thing has a short-term impact 5. (later tells the story of a woman who was run over by a truck) the happier people are not without setbacks or adversity, but they can get back to the right track faster. 6. Close family and friends. Conclusion: "play, have new experiences, having friends and family, doing things that are meaningful, appropriate what we have, these are things that make us happy, and they are free".

I totally agree with the message in the video. You don’t need money or material goods to be happy, you need a different frame of mind. People like the family catching crabs on the riverside or the tribe hunting wild animals are happier than those who are forced away from their families like those in Japan. They stress company loyalty so much in their society that it takes away their entire life until they finally fall from exhaustion. It seemed like the key to happiness is to spend time with others and forget the stress that comes with trying to make a living.

The statistics Ken gave in this video that correlated happiness to low emissions really started to get me thinking about what our culture considers happiness. The countries where people report higher levels of happiness lead much less of a material lifestyle than the United States does, and average wealth of said people is only a fraction of what it is for Americans. The American dream we all learned about growing up is something I think all Americans should strive for and be able to obtain, but I believe the definition of the American dream has been twisted by capitalism, leading Americans to believe that success and happiness and hard work comes in the form of material items that give us some kind of "status". Of course large companies want to sell this idea to us, that buying their items will give us the satisfaction we all want in life. No material item can do that for someone, and for most people this satisfaction is very temporary. Once it goes away, back comes the inclination to fill the void again with another item. This creates a perpetuate cycle many Americans seem to struggle overcoming, and many form addictions to shopping and feed into consumerism just like big companies wanted. Living in the digital age that we are now, I don't know if we can change this consumer society we have so easily. Advertising for new goods will never stop and it only becomes more powerful as ads become more personalized. This just makes people want to buy more. Telling people to just stop shopping and it actually working seems farfetched for our country unfortunately. The American view of happiness is extremely skewed, but changing it seems like a daunting task. The best that could be done at this time is starting to tax big companies that produce a lot of goods for their emissions in order to force them into using more sustainable practices because consumerism seems etched permanently onto the face of American society.

I enjoyed the film because it was not trying to push a single agenda. It just wanted to show why people were happier than others and that happiness can come in many different ways. They repeated throughout the film that "the formula for happiness is not the same for everyone", which is something I totally agree with. This is why I don't think there is a general solution to making people more happy. We have to do it one person at a time. Unfortunately, what makes some people happy could come at the expense of someone else's happiness. For example, if two people are going for a job promotion, the person who gets it is ecstatic. However, the employee who does not get it is stuck in the same possibly less-than-optimal situation which could further their plunge into sadness. 

  <br><br>

One aspect of happiness I liked that they pointed out was "people do really good when things go really bad". This immediately reminded me of when Kobe passed. Normally, when I go to Staples Center to watch a game, everyone is rude and trying to get by each other by pushing and shoving. However, when I went to see the Kobe memorial outside of Staples Center, it was a completely different story. People were comforting those who were feeling down, even if they had no idea who they were. Although I was heavily affected by Kobe's death, seeing people do good in the face of such a tragic event gave me hope. Hopefully, people can do good for others even when things are good, and hopefully they don't have to do it at the expense of others.

I noticed that the themes in this film resonate with the virtues of minimalism. It’s all more simple than it seems and I love that they use other cultures like that of Denmark to present the idea that money doesn’t equate to happiness. To me, going outside and seeing a pink horizon is enough to make me smile despite the current  troubles. It can be so simple sometimes. I loved that they explained  that circumstances like income, social status, and age serving as a mere portion of our happiness. Like the surfer in the video, surfing is a religion, to him however. I’m not a religious person but I want this to be what it represents—harmony to oneself. I also agree with the bad leads to good argument in that our pain often results in an evaluation of ourselves and sometimes even a revelation where we aspire to try again. Pleasure may lead to pain as is money leading to problems. Given the consumer culture we live in today, to many of us, establishing a basic needs only rule seems impossible; however, the video convinced me that adapting to less needs can be exciting. I grew up in a house of 12 people and I was therefore able to grow and adapt with people I loved. My family makes me happiest at all costs and I understand that not all people grow up with the easiest circumstances at home and it hurts because my home life has shaped me and I wish it was like that for everyone. This video was inspiring and made me rethink my treatment of the world. When I’m happy, I treat the world like my family and I wish there was an inherent communal responsibility that kept us from associating monetary wealth as a measure of happiness.

I am not surprised to see that seeking for personal growth takes a large portion of the pie when it comes to happiness. No one will feel happy when rushing through homework minutes before the deadline, no one will feel happy when getting yelled at by your boss for arriving late. These are what one needs to face when money becomes the only goal of your life. People become cynical, ruthless, cunning for the sake of money. Personal growth however can bring you to a spiritual level. That is your passion, things that you have always wanted to do. People say follow opportunities, don’t follow your passion. But once you are settled, your passion should be your new goal.
     <br><br>
After watching Happy and Being The Change, I realized that community is an indispensable part of one wishes to seek happiness. It is not just the social interaction that counts, it is also a re-direction of your sense of purpose. For people who have worked hard in a corporate environment, money becomes their purpose. A community can help people realize that money is not what counts. Everyone in the community is unique, and everyone can offer something unique, and everyone in the community recognizes your effort to serve. It is no longer competitive, but cooperative. For people who strives for personal growth, a community can provide a sense of purpose so that they don’t get lost.

Since the moment The United States gained its independence from the British we have created a distorted image of the "American Dream". One that is about happiness in materialism. The more you have the better your social status and the better you feel about yourself. This should not be how we measure ourselves or our happiness. This misguided 'pursuit of happiness' that is portrayed by celebrities in songs, movies, and other forms of pop culture has aided in the destruction of our planet. Unfortunately, we promote that the more you have and the more you buy, the happier you will be. As seen in the documentary, this is not the truth. Our ultimate desire for materialistic items is what is going to drive our world into eventual nonexistence. Our scale of our consumerist lifestyle is terrifying to think about. Our constant need for status and wealth has skewed how we view our own happiness. I bring this back to Peter Kalmus’ simpler life. Are we so far gone that the only way we will be happy is by wanting more? Maybe, but I think it’s worth a try to follow his method by reducing your fossil fuels therefore reducing your carbon footprint in order to gain happiness in the things that mean most in life.

Perhaps not directly a documentary on climate change, the film takes a pretty strong approach against the pursuit of material good and this concept of self-validation through the amount of wealth one harbors. America specifically is so driven on false pretenses of what makes a person happy. I wasn't surprised to hear that America is a very unhappy place, but the numbers are always even more gut-wrenching, especially compared to what it could be, just looking at the example other nations have set. Ken mentions this in his explanation of the film, and it really just goes to show how deeply set our society's foundations are built upon lies. From claims of democracy, to being what everyone wants you to be, that money runs the world when it doesn't have to, that everything will be fine if we just ignore the problem.
     <br><br>


We work too much, we buy things corporations tell us we need, we disregard community, and just generally lose the basics of what brings us happiness. It's no wonder happiness seems lost on us when money and society run our lives. I thin "Happy" was so great at conveying the lives of all these people who've come to lose so much, and yet despite their hardships, they still rise above it all. It's so inspiring and it really makes you re-evaluate your own lifestyles. If this woman, who was run over by a truck and had her husband leave her can find the joys in life, there's still goodness out there. I just hope we don't destroy this beautiful world that brings it to us before its too late.



</p><hr>


<p>
To start off by answering Ken's question, I believe that yes, we are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness. In the documentary "Happy" the audience can clearly see and contrast the lifestyles of people in other countries around the world, and how stark the difference is from the average American lifestyle. We’ve touched on it before, but American culture has evolved to be all about rampant consumerism and nearly uninhibited capitalism. In an environment where all the external stimuli i.e. advertisements, social media, and other forms of media such as movies, Youtube videos, and TV shows often portray and advocate this kind of consumption-based lifestyle, it is not hard to see why America is the way it is today. People are constantly buying things, changing out old products for the new ones, spending their hard earned money, generating an intense demand for everything from clothes to cars to makeup and houses. It’s this hardcore demand that drives the industries and markets to provide the supply, and these actions are truly killing the planet with how much greenhouse gases they emit. 

     <br><br>



If you think about it, it’s actually a very simple cycle to understand. People are told by the media, whether directly or indirectly, that they need to buy all kinds of products to be happy. These products are made and sold, generating profits for the industries and markets that sell them. To keep their revenue going, they spend big on advertisements to keep having people be interested in buying their products, and so the cycle repeats. This entire time, the cycle is pumping out devastating amounts of CO2 and methane into the atmosphere and exacerbating the problem of climate change. This is what I mean when I say that yes, we really are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness. 
     <br><br>


And when I say misguided, I mean that this cycle of consumerism does not even necessarily provide the consumers with the happiness that they want. As the documentary showed, people in other countries that don’t have such rampant consumerism the way it is here in America, often are much happier with their lives while having fractions of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. It’s really tragic to think about just how bad the problem of consumerism has become here in the United States.

To answer Ken’s question “are we destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness?” duhh. It’s so ironic that the American Dream has essentially become a lie, as it alludes to a path to true happiness through material possessions and status. Yet, in reality, none of these things contribute to one's well being in the slightest. As Ken pointed out in his video, the seven happiest countries in the world emit much less greenhouse gases than the average American, why? Because their cultures are centered around sharing. One of the many faults of the American way of life, is that we have never been fond of sharing, sharing our money, our resources, houses, you name it. For example, in the film “Happy” one of the main suggestions for pursuing true intrinsic happiness is to help others, love others, give to others, and surround yourself with people you love and to value genuine human connection. This is definitely not what comes to mind for an average American learning you are rightfully entitled to the “pursuit of happiness.” No, we American associate material wealth, social status and success with the pursuit of happiness. As a culture, we must reconsider what it means to be successful, and learn to appreciate and strive for what truly matters. I’m finally catching on to the theme of this class..once again, we need to advocate CULTURAL CHANGE, if we want to better the well-being of all Americans. And we need CULTURAL CHANGE if we want to curb the climate crisis, and improve the lives and future of the human race.

I agree with your comment, we do need a cultural change. I was shocked to learn that 40% of our happiness comes from our intentional behavior whereas only 10% comes from our circumstances. Take Japan for example, there are cities where people are literally working themselves to death with long hours, exhaustion, and sadness, but there is also Okinawa where people are still healthy at the age of 106 because they are surrounded by a supporting and caring community. No amount of money can buy you love and community, and because we can’t buy this, we have diverted to buying things that bring us a fleeting feeling of success. This, amongst other things, is what has caused the US to spiral into what I’ll call a “wealthy sadness.” This wealthy sadness has a biproduct of being harmful to the environment. In order to save our planet AND save ourselves, we need to change our culture for the better. There are countries like Denmark who already have a working system that we could adapt to, and this change needs to happen sooner rather than later.


<br><Hr>
I agree with your comment. Not only are we destroying the planet but we are destroying are chances of happiness. All of the clutter we accumulate just ends up stressing us out. I believe that the mindset of everyone for themself is valued very highly in today's society as well. Many want to live the high end lifestyle that we see celebrities achieve, but we fail to see that this will not truly make us happy. The more things we have does not guarantee happiness as shown in the lecture and the film Happy. I feel that what makes me most happy is when I am hanging out with my friends and family and this typically costs nothing depending on what you do. With all my friends we have made it almost a tradition to use Fridays as a chill day from all the stress as a reward and we typically just watch movies. This does not cost any money and I always enjoy Fridays, in fact I always look forward to them. I feel that since we accumulate so much clothes, we should know by now that this is not going to make us happy. It may for a second after the purchase, but will not last very long. Lastly, I do feel we need change. We need to realize that the things we buy won't make us happy for long and we need to be able to realize what we need from what we want. I feel that we tend to confuse these two especially if the average American is purchasing 60 new items of clothing a year. Many of these items have to be a want and not a need.

I totally agree with this comment. America has really messed up the idea of how happiness works. Happiness is not built off of material goods and wealth, happiness comes from relationships, having a purpose, and other things that make you feel good intrinsically. I understand the fact that if you don’t make enough money, it can be very hard to be happy because of the stress put on your life as you struggle paycheck to paycheck, but above that certain mark of money, happiness does not come from material goods. This is where America has gone wrong, while other countries such as the Scandinavian countries have done it correctly. They make sure their citizens have all the necessary things in life with healthcare and much more, but they also promote unity in those countries. There are co-housing communities that have people support each other instead of competing against each other like America does. And this comment was spot on when talking about how America needs a cultural change. People need to stop seeing each other as enemies in America and more as friends or family as not everything has to be a race to be the best, which is a big idea in America and could be considered the American dream. Our culture needs to be turned around into a culture of sharing and of focusing less on material goods and more on each other. That is the only hope that we have of improving our lives and also stopping the current climate crisis that we have.

Throughout this class, my view on American culture and the "american dream" has begun to shift towards how you're putting it: "happiness through material possessions and statuses.  It been a weird shift for me because i've always appreciated what this country has been able to do for my father and my family. I love my father and have grown up in admiration as he (I believe anyway) truly came from so little to his American Dream I live off of today.  My whole life, the American Dream was an position and a place where was one was able to provide for themselves, their family and those around them. This is the American dream i believe in. When I look around today, especially after watching the movie "Happy" in the context of this class, I am baffled at how regardless of all this power and wealth we americans posses, we still rank pretty low in terms of happiness; this is where I begin to feel my wholesome definition of the American dream begins to get twisted. We have come from promoting success through financial stability to being in this constant want for more more more. Even when we seem to have enough to live and even thrive, we still cant seem to satiate that hunger for the latest eye grabbing thing we look at. 
     <br><br>

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie "Happy" and believe it has alot to do with climate change. From a young age we are told that to "be popular" and "cool" you have to have the nicest clothes, keep up with the loudest trends and have the newest technology. Seemingly enough, the country that is addicted to this materialism is incredibly unhappy AND contributing an insane amount towards climate change. It all comes down to what we prioritize as success. I loved how in the movie they brought up that point that, yes money is important. YES! It unfortunately is! When you're living with shit conditions and struggling, money tends to make life easier, but as soon as we begin to move out of that struggle into more financially stable conditions, the the priorities need to switch. I believe, like Bhutan, to switch to prioritizing  a sort of "base happiness" in the US by at least providing basic needs to the American people. You're absolutely right Ruby in that a cultural change is what we need!!! I just hope the Green New Deal will be able to not only pave a streamline way to fight climate change, but also make America happy again.

The question Ken presents “Are we indeed destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness?” And the answer to that is yes. The film portrays the different ways people find happiness in perhaps the simplest manners, whether that’s spending time with family or friends, or doing things that bring you joy. The film points out how many of us in society believe that money is true happiness because we have this perception that money will solve all of our problems. The film brings to our attention that we as humans tend to focus on three major things which include: money, image, and status, this phenomenon that society has created for us to focus on. I find it so interesting how the film is able to transition to different parts of the world exposing the way people choose to live their lives to be actually happy. Japan, presented as a perfect example of happiness diminishing within a certain part of that country. In which people living their focus so much in becoming the breadwinners, that they are literally working themselves to death, and present such low levels of happiness. It’s extremely disheartening to understand how many people misconstrue the true meaning of happiness.

I agree with your response to his question. Our country is obsessed with having the next big thing and that combined with the "money buys you happiness" an attitude is a dark place many people find themselves stuck in once it's too late. Our individualistic way of life combined with this artificial sense of happiness is what causes people to ignore those around them. I also enjoyed how each place defines true happiness in different ways because it brings to light that not everyone engages in self-destructive (as well as environmentally destructive) habits to give themselves the illusion they are happy. The message here reminds me of the Minimalism film where they discussed the obsession over fast fashion and why it proves to be a major issue in a lot of people's lives. The notion of owning more as a result of working more is how Americans define their sense of worth, but does it really make anyone happy? Does spending countless amounts of paychecks on things they don't need just so they can feel similar to these social media influencers they follow really matter that much? People need to take a good look at what they consider happiness and reevaluate how their actions contribute to their well-being if they want to stray away from a consumerist lifestyle.


<br><hr>
I agree. We are destroying our planet in our pursuit of happiness. I like how you reference Japan as the antithesis of happiness. Money, image, and status are important over there, but also the more subtle things in life like family and tradition. The reason why they are so overworked is because of how badly these things interact. They strive for money and status for their family, making them work harder and harder until they collapse. Maybe money and status don’t bring happiness, but it definitely makes things more convenient, allowing people to misconstrue whether they are really happy after a certain point. Maybe the trick really is to live a more simple life.

“Happy” is not necessarily an environmental documentary, it is more in the class of a mental health documentary. For example it starts with an Indian man with not a lot of money, but he is still happy, he says “I feel that i am not poor, but I am the richest person” because of the people he surrounds himself with, making him rich with happiness. Many people, especially Americans and other societies consumed by consumerism think that happiness is defined by how much money you have, and all the things you can buy, but this documentary tries to inform the reader that happiness is more than what you have. Scientists in the documentary talk about how the release of dopamine creates happiness, and aerobic exercise is a big release of this brain chemical. The directors of this documentary show the testimonies of many people who may not come from the richest place, have the most money or the biggest houses, but they all demonstrate such happy and tranquil lives despite not having all the money in the world. Much of what we believe about the causes and sources of happiness is not simply true, both good and bad events have an impact on our moods in the future, in general people do really go when things go really bad; this is demonstrated by the story of a beautiful lady who got run over by a truck. The truck went over her head and spine and crushed her face in the rocks, she had to be in the ICU, and her face became distorted, and her husband divorced and left her. Many would think that this would lead to unhappiness, which it can, she thought about killing herself and was very angry but always wanted to be there for her kids, but overtime her thinking like this dissipated, and she healed and found this source of happiness. Many people believe that happiness is found through buying things, and having stuff, but the documentary “Happy” provides evidence that proves this otherwise.

I noticed a vast difference in this film compared to most others that Ken had assigned so far. As you helpfully pointed out, this film was not exactly about the environment and how to save it or the pursuit to solve the climate crisis but it was more about the pursuit of happiness. I appreciated the most that the directors and producers of this film, rather than talk on and on about scientific research on happiness, they interviewed actual people from all over the globe even to show the audience upfront that true happiness was achievable. This made me incredibly happy to see...well the happiness of others who on the outside seemed like they had less than most but what they lacked in materialistic crap, they more than made up for in the fulfillment of themselves as a person. How many Americans today can say that they are completely satisfied with their lives rather than admit that they’re still striving for more? Unfortunately I feel like not a great deal of us could actually say that, me included. When those people were asked if they were happy, I found myself asking myself the same question. I became much more self aware with this film and can honestly say that it is my favorite film out of all the ones we’ve had assigned.
     <br><br>
Going back to your comment about how this isn’t exactly an environmental film, I would actually like to disagree on that. While it may not outright be bringing out stats on how long this planet has and the urgency of the situation, it highlighted the biggest solution at the core of the climate crisis. And that solution is all this film was about...finding true happiness. If you think about it, the people that were interviewed didn’t come from the wealthiest backgrounds and were clearly not leaving a big carbon footprint. Why? Because they have no desire to consume like Americans love to do. If the majority of individuals in the U.S found true happiness with what they had rather than seeking it by buying more and more, what would that do to production companies that are polluting our air? They’re forced to produce less to match demand. Maybe the answer we’ve been searching for is an answer we need to all find within ourselves...happiness.

I like this film because it makes me think a lot.
      <br><br>

Aristotle believes that the fundamental goal of life is happiness. In today’s life, most people think that the only way to get happiness, to get success, is to work hard, earn lots of money, drive the fastest cars, and live in huge houses. In this perspective, satisfaction does not come from the activities themselves, but the things they bring. However, according to a survey from 1950-2010, although the average income increased a lot, people did not feel much happier than before. People once have basic needs met, more money cannot bring more happiness to them. The film points out that whatever level of wealth or material goods you have, once you get used to it, you will have the desire to have more. This is called Hedonic adaptation, which is a huge enemy to happiness. A scientific study showed that 40% of happiness level comes from intentional activities (what people choose to do). Aside from extrinsic goals of value (which means people gain happiness from external things like money, image, and status), in this film, the author pays much more attention to introduce the other kind of goals of value: intrinsic goals (personal growth, relationships, and desire to help).
      <br><br>

Following the filmmaker’s interviews and descriptions in different parts of the world, I find more sources of happiness: do whatever you want to do, spend time feeling the nature, have a new experience, stay with close families and friends, keep the compassion, do something meaningful, and appreciate what we already have. What impressed me the most is the story of Melissa Moody. She was such a beauty that her photo was posted on Town and Country of 1969 as one of the 50 Top Debutantes. Unfortunately, a tragedy happened in 1992: she was run over by a truck and she was seriously injured, even disfigured. It was a huge shock to her that she once fell into a negative life. However, she finally chose to release and accept everything and found her true love. A happy person also has adversities from time to time, but what makes a difference is that he/she can quickly come back down to the base. In other words, one of the most important ingredients of happiness is to recover from adversities more quickly. In fact, I am deeply resonated in this story: I am exactly a person who CANNOT quickly recover from adversity. Even when it was just a trivial thing, I may be upset for days. I know that I can’t change things which have happened, and I should put my attention on the future. However, I usually regret my previous decisions and often fantasize about unrealistic scenarios. Regretting the past and fearing the future, I usually put a lot of pressure on myself. Maybe that’s why happiness seems to be rare in recent years of my life.
      <br><br>

I still remember the question put forward by the professor in the last term: Are we indeed destroying our planet in a profoundly misguided pursuit of happiness? My answer is YES. The extrinsic goals and the stereotype of success are still dominating in most people’s minds, but in lots of circumstances, people have no choice but to follow this “problematic” mode. Just as mentioned in the film, in Japan, people work for an extremely long time without proper rests. Some people even died because they are so exhausted (local people call this KAROSHI). Are they trying to earn excessive money to enjoy a luxurious life? No, they work so hard just to live an ordinary life.
      <br><br>

Moreover, the combination of individualism and morbid consumption is still a serious problem in today's society. It takes time to change people’s values and even the structure of societies. Driven by contemporary values, it is difficult for us to give up pursuing money and status. If I do not study hard, or do not work hard in the future, and tell others that I want to pursue true happiness, I think most people will not understand this idea, and only I think that I am too lazy or think that I am escaping from reality. So I believe the ideal solution is to achieve a balance between intrinsic and extrinsic happiness. Anyway, there is still hope: I see some people around me prefer the intrinsic goals of value and are willing to take action to appeal to others.

The portrayal of all of the happy people living such varied lifestyles was something I have never seen before. The film, “Happy,” was a very emotional film for me to watch. Learning about the hedonic adaptation was eye opening. People constantly are wanting more things. Also, it is shocking and heartbreaking that people in Japan are dying from being overworked. That is not how anyone should live their lives. People who live in Japan are the least happy of the developed countries, when they seem to be one of the most technologically advanced. They are experiencing “material prosperity.” This goes to show that material items aren’t equated with happiness. Conversely, in Denmark, the co-housing communities enable the people to live happier and simpler lives. Each family only has to make dinner once or twice a month. For someone like myself who is not much of a cook, that seems like a great thing. During so much of the film I was smiling, and other parts made me really contemplate my life. Watching the film was a very nice experience. 
      <br><br>

Ken explains that our happiness has declined with our advancement of using fossil fuels. The happiest countries have “half, one third, or one fourth” of the emissions that we do, despite the fact that they live in energy demanding cooler climates. These Scandanavian countries are democratic socialists. Healthcare is guaranteed for all, and more, because they put first the wellbeing of the people. Conversely, in the United States the government cares for the wellbeing of the “large corporate sponsors,” rather than the people, which is the billionaires. 
      <br><br>

Overall, living in Sweden seems so wonderful. They work less, they have at least 25 paid vacation days, and they have a huge amount of paid paternity leave. To top it off, their emissions are one quarter of the average American, and when adjusted to their colder climate, this might be reduced to one eighth. This seems like the good life to me. This should be the model for the United States. 
      <br><br>

We are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness. If we make the societal change to adjust our lifestyles to help the climate, like Sweden, we will become happier. This is no longer a guessing game. The people who live environmentally friendlier lifestyles are happier. This is seen in the countless examples given by the movie. We need to make this change, and then happiness will follow.

I absolutely think that Americans would be happier if we changed our culture. So much of the American Dream is based on individualism and competitive nature without any thought on collective well being. The climate crisis is forcing us to start to consider collective well being especially since there are groups of being that will be significantly more at risk than other groups. The parts I always love about the movie are the co-housing units and the man that serves at the home for the destitute and dying.
      <br><br>
The co-housing unit truly forces people to live together and take care of each other. As the mother mentioned in the film, this gives her a sense of community while saving her time and energy on household duties such as chores and making meals. This also creates an amazing community for children to grow up in. They have a whole swath of people from different ages and backgrounds that all help to support them. These younger groups in part help care for those that are sick and elderly. I think the US would greatly benefit from more communities like this. However, I do want to add that many low-income families already in a co-housing styled living situation due to low income. So it is definitely on the government to help back this initiative and help give those people more secure and adequate housing. 
      <br><br>
The former wealthy bank executive was someone that really struck me in the film. His decision to cast away his wealth and work lifestyle to go and selflessly care for the poor demonstrates the love that is capable of human beings. I think that Americans really suck at charitable work because we see it as a problem we can just throw our money too without having to actually take time out of lives to physically do. I'm not saying that everyone should be quitting their jobs to work full time in a shelter, but maybe volunteering at food banks, domestic abuse safe houses, animal shelters and so forth more often. Not only will we be tangibly helping others, but the research shows we will become happier by doing so.

I think that what social media has done to our generation is absolutely insane and I'm amazed that even though so many people say that social media is something that they want to get off of, but no one really does it. However, the few the do, have started to find more happiness in the important things. I have started to not use Instagram and Snapchat as much as I used to and I almost never post pictures and I genuinely think that I have been able to spend more time with the people that mean the most to me because I'm not worried about what someone posted the other day. 

      <br><br>

I believe that social media needs revamping. I think that it is the perfect platform for activists to rise up and spread awareness, however, its gonna take some time to shift the culture towards that mindset. I think one of the biggest steps that our generation is gonna have to take, is to put down the phone and start paying attention to the people and the world around us. Stop just looking at pictures of what our actions are doing to our earth and look directly at the ash and burnt trees that lay where forests used to. And look at the places where many animals used to roam but are now extinct. Start looking and start doing. No one cares about what new clothes you have... People need to care about how much longer we have to live on our beautiful planet.

It is so refreshing to watch this because it just reinforces the fact that money cannot buy happiness.  Sure, one needs a certain amount of money to be able to buy the necessities, but beyond a certain point the money one has is essentially useless in the sense that they have excess money that they do not need to use on themselves because it will not make them any happier or benefit them.  Seeing as many people in the developed world, especially those who are wealthy and use their money to splurge on things that they really don’t need, spend their money on the latest and greatest trends, I think that it would be much more worthwhile to spend this money on solutions to the climate crisis.  This way they are left feeling happier and more accomplished as they are now a part of the solution to this urgent issue, in addition to putting their money towards something that makes a difference.  Otherwise, people will continue to follow this misguided American Dream of the pursuit of happiness and continue to waste the vast potential for change that they hold.  People must stop their wasteful ways in filling the void with stuff, and understand that stuff does not equal happiness.
       <br><br>

People can use their money for good instead of meaningless stuff and this can also help to mend and fix injustices experienced whether it is the environment or other social issues.  Both are very intertwined and the excess money can be used to do good in this world.  The United States needs to follow the lead of other European countries, specially those Scandanavian countries, which hold the position of the happiest countries in the world.  Following their lead, the United States can decrease country wide greenhouse gas emissions while increasing happiness.
       <br><br>

We could also stand to learn from Costa Rica because they are a happier country than the United States, while the average American has 13 times as wealthy as the average Costa Rican.  That is so sad that we are so misguided in thinking that buying more stuff makes us happier that we can’t realize how wrong we are and that quite the opposite is true.  Costa Ricans are able to actually focus and find meaning in their lives as Americans distract themselves with stuff to cover up the fact that they are not actually happy with their current situation.  We need to take away the distractions and really pursue what gives our lives meaning.

To answer your question, yes, I think that we are destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness. I’m really glad I had the opportunity to watch “Happy” and it raised questions about my own happiness. When I think about what career I want to pursue in my future, I think about the salary that each of my options would have. Growing up, not having even money meant that I missed out on some things and made life harder in a lot of ways. So I can see how having money can help you in your pursuit of happiness, but not if you have too much of it. People in the U.S. are constantly chasing that bag, which is why it’s ranked #19 in the world in terms of happiness. You just can’t be happy if you’re always looking for the next best thing to add to your collection. The film also showed that in Japan, people are largely unhappy, and it’s because they focus way too much on business, and not enough on family and friends. This is in contrast to the people of Okinawa, who live long, happy lives. They attribute their happiness to their close relationships with their communities, like people do in Denmark. The pattern here is that neither a larger carbon footprint nor greater wealth is the answer to having a truly fulfilling life. The evidence points to lower carbon emissions being a pattern in generally happier countries, and the U.S. should pay attention to that.

The typical portrayal of the American Dream prioritizes financial success over anything else. I grew up in Silicon Valley and it was very commonly held belief that the most important decision to be made by kids is what college and major will cause people to make the most money. I had one friend who said she disliked computer science, but she was still going to major in it because she was good at it and could make a lot of money off of it. I asked her if she wouldn't rather do something she enjoyed and she responded by saying she could just do that stuff during her free time. However, as Ken said in the video, 40% of Americans spend more than 50 hours/week working. This is a significant amount of time to be spent doing something you dislike. While this decision will likely make my friend a lot of money, I wonder if it will make her any happier. I suspect it won't.

       <br><br>

Another personal example I have that shows that what people prioritize in our society isn't necessarily what will bring you the most happiness is my choice to attend UCSB. I was also accepted into UCLA and almost everyone in my life told me I would be insane to turn that down. However, I had the opportunity to visit both campuses and had fallen in love with the UCSB campus almost immediately. I saw smiling people playing frisbee, going to the beach, biking, and generally having fun. When I visited UCLA I felt trapped by the surrounding city, and almost everyone I saw was unhappily traversing the hilly campus to get to class. I also knew that UCLA was more competitive, and I did not want another four years of that after having gone through high school in Silicon Valley. I am extremely happy with my choice and have loved life at UCSB, even though it was not the choice that most Americans would consider the smart one.

       <br><br>

I think prestige and materialistic value do not correspond to happiness. That is something I came to realize throughout watching the whole film "Happy". There were a lot of different people in difficult situations, yet many of them were happy because they found something they loved to do or surrounded themselves with people they love. People need to make individual decisions that will make them feel fulfilled and satisfied, rather than merely prioritizing success.

Finally, we are here. We are not discussing the climate crisis this week, but happiness. Happiness, as described in the film, is not what we expected. Happiness is a skill, we can make our brains more positive, and make ourselves happier. One thing I really agree with is that happy populations also have several things in common: having close friends and families, compassion, doing meaningful things. People feel happy when we are collaborating when we are feeling been needed when we are doing things we like, and when we are with ones we love. Happiness is free for us all, and I really love one quote from the end of the film, “if you are happy, everyone is happy in this world.” Yet, there is still one thing that surprises me. 50% of our happiness comes from genetics, and 40% comes from how we decide to do, and only 10% of our current circumstances(social status, wealth, etc.) It is scientifically true that we can make ourselves happy. And I really can feel what the film is trying to tell the audience. As an international student, I have never been away from my home that far and that long. I am 10000 miles and 16 hours away from home. And for me, who has an extremely strong bond with my family, it is so hard for me to live happily alone in the United States. My first quarter here was tough, extremely tough. I even thought of completely gave up all the academic workload and just went home. I cried all day, and I felt depressed all the time. But I tried to that situation by myself. I called home more frequently, and I reached out more to create more fun for myself here at UCSB. And now it’s the second quarter of mine, and I am much better. I feel happy to be here for college. Of course, I miss home, but I can live happily here on my own. Happiness is the most crucial part of people's live; we can live without it. So let’s just create happiness for our own to live our lives more joyfully. Be happy, both you and the Earth.

This documentary reminds me of Minimalism. Both of these films helped people realize what can make them happier. Happy, like how I said with Minimalism, is killing two birds with one stone. It helps people become happier and it also helps out our environment. It helps out our planet by telling us that having all these possessions and money does not make us happy. And if everyone wants to be happy we should focus on helping each other out. So if we helped out our planet, I’m pretty sure that we will become happier. This is shown by the fact of the top happy countries like Sweden and Denmark. They do not produce as much carbon as the United States yet they are happier than us. I am not saying that they are happy because they produce less carbon. I’m saying that they are happier due to the reason they produce less carbon. They realized that helping out our planet and community is what makes up happy. This film also reminds me of The Great Gatsby, where one of the protagonists is super wealthy but he is not happy.  This is also another example of why having all these luxuries is not gonna make you happier.  There is a limit of the amount of money that makes you feel joy,  people who make more than this amount might need to realize that buying things is not going to make you happier.

We shouldn't have to destroy the planet in order to be happy. The problem with humanity is that we have a hedonic adaptation that leads us to believe we always need more. If more money is supposed to make us happy, how come we don't see a rise in happiness in the USA as a result of an increase in consumer society? I think the point of this documentary is that intrinsic values are better at producing happiness than extrinsic material wealth. I believe the purpose behind Ken including this as a part of our course curriculum is to give us examples of happiness in harmony with the planet. Denmark is an example to the rest of the world due to their new habits of co-habitation. I think it is amazing that they live in a community where everyone has a role and an ability to help. They say it "takes a village" to raise children and Denmark's families who live together embody that. In fact to them, it "takes a village" to live in general because they all contribute to doing chores that helps maintain their way of living. They garden and they share their food so less goes to waste. The only thing stopping Americans from adopting this lifestyle is our sense of entitlement. Well guess what. We aren't entitled to the resources that this planet has to offer. Nature works in a circle and we tend to disrupt that circle more often than helping it. I wish we could have the attitude that the gentleman from Louisiana had about living a simplistic life. All we really need is family, friends, and our basic needs met. His philosophy of living off the land is desirable in my opinion. 
           <br><br>
 We don't need THINGS to be happy. We need FLOW. We need to find something that is satisfying by itself alone and allow ourselves to give into it. Whether it is surfing, hiking, painting, meditating, or anything you can think of just pick something. You will feel more fulfilled when you are able to make yourself happy without feeling the need to chase a paycheck to buy your happiness. Yes money is needed for basic happiness but as the video shows, excess wealth does nothing for our overall happiness. Get moving, lean in, and engage in life rather than waiting for your next chance to buy something.

In replying to the main question of "are we destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness?", I do think that this stands true in a lot of cases. Our current society itself is built for us to value more materialistic things and success in materialistic terms, than any other thing. In the process of civilization, we have been trained to long for more and more physical senses of happiness, rather than focusing on the emotions or interests we actually feel inside. This film, "Happy" is part of the movement that has emerged in the last few decades to reshape our human culture definition of happiness.

Happiness is a personal definition, everyone's happiness revolves around different things, events, people, etc. However, we are more and more trying to conform to society's sense of happiness and change their lifestyle. A cultural change is needed to change the way we treat the environment. This has been repeatedly stated. Happiness, along with the environment, has faced a negative impact in terms of our current culture. 
           <br><br>
However, just as Denmark and other countries of the high quality of living ratings, a movement against our current culture has started and is taking place. The rest of society just needs to join the initiatives and change our human culture for the better of the environment and happiness.

Happiness truly is a personal experience, and yet by following society's whims, as you mention, we're attempting to create this experience as a collective, losing the uniqueness everyone's personal livelihoods and interests bring. It's really a tragic realization. So many books have professed the idea of society producing carbon copies, and I think they're all correct in their projections. As our pursuit of the "American Dream" leads to lacking ingenuity, the happiness falls alongside. It is good that people are moving towards activism as you mentioned. Not only does working towards changing the model probably create happiness, but as the film insinuated without necessarily pointing out specifically, finding something to do makes people happier, and I would think that activism would be such a great way to make people feel a sense of importance in truly doing something that can change the world.

I agree with you that individuals can experience happiness through things that differ from one another, but materialism is something that most people will associate with happiness. Despite that notion, it is proven to not be the key to happiness. It is interesting how society and culture can help promote something that in turn dictates how people should feel about it. It would be more beneficial to society, in terms of improving overall well-being and the environment, if these studies that talked about the true effects of wealth on happiness or the happier countries that are not only looking at money were being promoted as much to the general public. Moreover, in the same way that money is equated to happiness, the association of consumerism, stress from overworking to pay for everything, and the detriment it has to the planet should evoke strong negative feelings in people.

Of course we will be happier coming out of the climate crisis. And this won't be as a result of coming out of the crisis, but I think in many ways the opposite could be true, coming out of the crisis could be a result of us being happier. What do I mean by that? Well, if humans become more conscious beings, and gain more control over their spiritual selves, then of course they will be happier. By doing so they would be able to break free from the shackles of (over)capitalism and the active manipulation that the consumerist society is experiencing. 
           <br><br>

As we have seen in the film, a big part of being happy is catering to the natures of being a human, exercising, being kind, thankful and helpful to other people and the society in general, and being in touch with mother nature. If we humans were actively doing all of this, making it a main part of our daily lives, then how would we allow the climate crisis to go on unabated?  I think the same things that will solve the climate crisis, are the same things that will make us humans happier, they are part of the same thing, catering to the good part of our natures, the part that makes us human.

As a last point I just want to say how distraught I was listening to both of the bullied boys. The shorter one especially resonated with me because of my brother, who was also the shortest kid in the class growing up. He went through a lot having to deal with that and it was just moving and disturbing seeing the EXACT same agony and pain externalized by that child - it gave me the chills. I feel like most of the people that bully others don't even understand it subconsciously, they have no real conception of what they're doing, and the real and deep effects it can have on the receptors.

We made the pursuit of happiness one of our three unalienable rights in the United States. But as Ken mentioned, the American Dream is now centered on having bigger and “better” things, but this has not made us happier. We spend all of our money on things we really don’t need. And people (and companies) are exploiting labor of others just to make a quick buck (more like millions). The documentary “Happy” made a good point when they said that the difference in happiness between a person who makes $5,000 and $50,000 is dramatic, but the difference between $50,000 and 5 million is barely anything. More money does not bring greater happiness. Money can make us happier by getting us basic needs, like housing and food and health care, but after that money doesn’t make you much happier. We should be focused on making sure that every single person on the planet has full basic human rights and then we can work on making the quality of life better. There is no reason for millionaires and billionaires to exist when billions of people in the world do not have basic human rights. We have hundreds of millions of people going without clean water, who are malnourished, don’t have shelter or family, and worse. Redistributing the wealth seems only fair considering our capitalism and war has worsen the lives of billions of people.

We don’t need as much money so we should be working less! And we can spend that time with our families. I remember as a kid my parents would come home exhausted from work and would relax in the garage or bedroom so I would only see them for dinner time mainly. That definitely did not help my relationship with my parents. Not saying that them working less would have fixed everything, but at least I would have been able to see them more. That’s why I love how the film talks about co housing. It’s a highly efficient way to live. You split the workload with others and are in a loving supporting environment, which leads to less stress and more happiness. You spend less time cooking and cleaning so you can spend more time with yourself, family, and friends. I love this idea and I truly hope one day I can do something like this. 
           <br><br>

One last thing that I enjoyed in the movie was the part about the island of Okinawa, Japan. The people there are happier and live longer. They eat dinner with their family, go to bed early, and wake up early. It makes them function better and feel more refreshed and productive. The elders get together every day and have tea and talk about what’s going on in their lives and days. Not only is that good that they are spending time with their friends, it’s also very good for their mental health too. My first thought was wondering how close this group of people must be. And the amount of trust they must have for each other. Then they mentioned how the word “icharibachode” means that when you meet someone you are already brother and sister. It’s neat that they are already trusting and loving someone as family even if it’s their first time meeting. I would definitely need some practice with that, but it’s a cool concept. I’m inspired by the compassion and love that the people in this documentary have. It makes me hopeful for a happier planet soon.

My past Spanish teacher always made comments about how America is a slave to the clock. We are always stressed from running from place to place or event to event. In Spain, people take siestas and shops close down during the afternoon so people can relax. Even meals in Europe are prolonged so conversations can occur and people can bond. I don't remember sitting at a meal with my family for over an hour while in America, but in Europe we spend close to three hours every night. I envy the sense of freedom from the clocks. I miss doing the things I loved like swimming for a team or hiking every day, but I feel like I lack the motivation now because it has been so long since I have done it. I don't realize the importance doing the things I love, but now I am inspired to get back into it.

One of the biggest issues with America, and I’d even say the world, in general, is this constant ‘pursuit of happiness” and the “American Dream.” Every day, people go to work and barely manage to make it through their 9-5 only to go back home, eat, sleep and repeat the process again. They don’t derive joy from their work, they do it for other reasons, namely, money. But money doesn’t bring happiness, no matter how much of it you have. It really doesn’t. Money might solve some of your current problems sure, but simply replaces them with a different set of problems. 
           <br><br>


Take the people of Okinawa. Despite being bombed and losing countless lives, these people have still managed to find the bright points in life rather than focus on everything that has gone wrong. I have the utmost respect for them being able to see the bright side of life rather than be dragged down by the bad side. It’s all a matter of perspective. You can truly live life how you want to live it if you have the mental capacity to push yourself in that direction. Of course, you will face hardships, and I’m not telling you they don’t matter. But how you choose to handle your trauma and hardships is what will define your happiness moving forward. Ronaldo Fadul said it best when he described how he lives life, saying to do things that you want to do and are passionate about, regardless of how “successful or not” society views one in that line of work. Surgeon or surfer is, all the same, he argues if both are enjoying what they have chosen to do.

I personally, not to brag, have been living like this for as long as I remember. I don’t know how, but I arrived at the conclusion one day that if I’m living life, I’m going to live it how I want to live it. I do what makes ME happy. I don’t want to be at the end of my life one day and look back with disappointment in my life decisions. We only have one shot at this life, we have to make the most of it. I try not to let school affect me too much. I’m passionate about my grades, but I don’t let it stress me out, as long as I know I’ve done all I could to get the best grades possible. Stress does nothing for you, and trying to eliminate it from your day to day life, even in small increments, is a huge step in the direction of happiness.

This film  touches on the American Dream. It displays the difference of culture and living in other countries and how the American lifestyle has changed. There are so many more expectations and responsibilities and it’s hard to meet all of them while maintaining good mental health. Watching this film was very much a recap of what we’ve gone over so far. The problems with society and why materialistic people are more depressed because there’s always something better out there. The constant feeling of it never being enough. The tendency for people of modern society to feel as if they’re lesser beings if they have less material things than the people around them. When learning that the top 5 happiest countries emit about half of our emissions is absolutely insane which goes to show that us as a country may be excessively emissions. Many of these countries at the top for happiness tend to be countries that live in colder climates than us and yet they use far less energy than us. The fact that they range from using ½ to ¼ of our energy while their country demands more is something that we need to think about.

The idea of achieving happiness is quite perplex as a young American individual. As stated, we are brought up with the idea that working hard to obtain the greatest amount of wealth is what will ultimately make us most happy and content in life. For instance, I came to a rather prestigious 4 year university, not just because I love learning or it's near the beach, but to hopefully gain enough experience and knowledge to one day fall into a well paying job. This idea of chasing monetary wealth creates a stifling dichotomy when contrasted with the idea of chasing a wealth of happiness. Ultimately, when initially coming to university I was immediately combated with the feeling that simply doing well in class was not going to be enough to keep me happy. Instead it became the little things like watching the sunset, or hanging out with friends that kept me most grounded and content with my new life in Santa Barbara. Consequently, I feel like it is extremely important to create a balance in life between monetary success and overall mental or social health. Although we live in an American society that is often characterized as very fast paced, I do not believe it has gotten to the same extremes displayed in the examples of Japan's deathly work force in the film. Ultimately, as we move forward as a society I connect many of my thoughts back to the ideas presented in the minimalism film and how by simply slowing down the pace of one's life can lead to better mental health. Happiness is not necessarily a direct link to the environment, however these practices of drastically scaling back one's consumer mindset and focusing on the present can definitely create a healthier human and environment.

For many people, happiness is something that is sought throughout an entire lifetime and rarely gained for many. Some people put happiness as something that can be bought through a materialistic sense, while others have found happiness through experiences and with the company of others and loved ones. If only there were an equation for happiness we could all follow, right? As people grow older and closer to death, many come to the realization that the only thing that truly makes them happy in the long run is through experiences and being with people they love and spend time with. Because of the emphasis on trends and fast fashion and the like, our society has shifted towards finding happiness through materialistic things. The problem with this though is that materialistic things only provide a sense of happiness for so long before the next item is sought after and that the only long term solution to happiness is through non-materialistic things. Materialism can be considered one of the root problems of the climate crisis as the mass manufacturing of items hurts global emissions greatly and if we as a society begin to come to the conclusion that experiences are the key to happiness faster we could reduce greenhouse emissions greatly and slow the rate of global warming.

Actually, I think this idea really makes sense. This is the reason why Thoreau and Yuanming Tao and minimalism exist. Minimalism eliminate this problem. It is an easier and much cooler lifestyle than materialism. I suggest people to try the lifestyle of minimalism, because it can help people release a lot of stress. Then, with less stress exist, people will become happier, and being happy is valuable in life.
<br><hr>
I agree that it is through this false aim at happiness paved through consumeristic goods that the climate crisis is able to persist. Therefore, it seems vital to raise awareness through documentaries like the one shown that this path is made up of small bursts of happiness that always leave one chasing more, rather than the more sustainable way by focusing one’s efforts on true human connection. A remark I found most interesting in this film was the mention of happiness as a skill. I had not previously viewed it this way, always expecting that being happy would come and go with whatever circumstances I was in. Now, however, it makes sense that it must take an active effort to sift out negativities and remain a positive outlook. I haven’t ever been shocked to hear that many who are poor and live without excess but who also have strong familial and friend connections have ultimately found their happiness. To live this way means to be the most authentic version of oneself, without the materialistic items to cover up or ignore true identity. In addition, it is unsurprising that surrounding oneself with people you are most connected to and forming and maintaining genuine relationships and bonds is sure to bring true happiness. I think this film pieces together a great argument that must be spread: it is not through money that real happiness can be found.
<br><hr>
The more I digest this documentary and its comments, the more I wonder what is the relation between happiness and the climate crisis. I know this is a shallow idea but… . It is hard to pursuit happiness. Being minimalism is easy, but due with GPA and work and a lot of stuffs are really hard. Are there any people who believe that happiness can avoid the climate crisis? Lol. This is a good question.

As Americans I think we have been raised under the ideology that we need to work hard to get a well paying job and to live happily.  We have thus been pressured to study hard in school to get good grades for a resume, apply for top colleges, and more all to try to apply to the highest paying job we can get.  This has bred the implication and idea that with money comes happiness, but with recent studies, this is just not true.  In the end, all the studying and hard work would result in just more hard work and long hours in a job that we are not happy about.  We lose sight of the pursuit of happiness when we see money, and we instead decide to chase a well paying job.  Not only do these societal pressures and norms result in unhappy lives, but they contribute heavily to the environmental crisis.  After thinking about it, the pursuit for money really does not make sense at all with regards to the environment and how it will affect our lives.  It is a hegemony that we reinforce on ourselves and others without even questioning it or even considering or thinking about it.  Progressed nations such as the Nordic countries have managed to address the flaws of this hegemony as instead of prioritizing money, they see the value in happiness and what makes life purposeful.  
           <br><br>


I was recently in an argument with someone over how these Nordic countries have prominent social ideologies, and they counter-claimed that these countries come with problems.  It is important to know that there will never be a perfect nation or Utopia, and no one really expects that out of socialist policies.  However, these democratic socialist policies have prominent evidence that they can manage a country better than capitalist policies.  The ranked happiness of the Nordic countries should be enough evidence in itself.

The Japanese family’s story is typical. Most people spend all of their time pursuing something illusory. For example, in traditional eastern asian culture, the young people have the responsibility to compose the family. Thus, after people graduate, they spend twenty or thirty years on making money in order to maintain the family. However, if the person ignores the noise from parents and society standards, he can save those twenty years to do the thing he really enjoys in every second of the process rather than regrets in fifty years old and excused with no other choice. 
           <br><br>
Same situation for aggressive young people in the world. In most of the nations, such as China, US, the social mobility is weak and the layers are solid. The probability across the layer of society is small. Thus, even the young people spend all their life making money, developing the influence, or gathering power, there still only a small portion of them succeed and most of them will either give up or die regrettably. However, there is no reason to be sad, because if you are studying at ucsb, you are already at least consuming more money than 99 percent of people in the world per year, even this is just because you win the ovarian lottery and barely related with your personal ability.

I liked your comment because of how you mentioned a different culture's susceptibility to illusionary measures of happiness. I feel like a lot of the class focuses on Western culture's drive for consumerism and effectively blames the US for 'spreading' this mindset to other cultures but ignores the fact that this mindset has been prominent in other technologically advanced cultures: such as a Japan. I think it's just human instinct to want more things than other people and the inherent need to dominate our surroundings as way of retaining control over our lives.
           <br><br>
Being a dual American-Tunisian citizen, I have seen first hand how people in Tunisia are becoming more materialistic and obsessed with status. It's not just that other countries who had a 'head start' down this path has influenced Tunisians, but it's also due significantly to the rise of technology and the non stop communication potential that arise from them. It's already in the culture, especially in Muslim countries where masculinity dominates every aspect of people's lives. The prominence of goods to buy and wealth disparities just further accelerate this cultural phenomenon.. Now that people can show off their wealth to people over the internet, greed and desires grow and so does this illusion of happiness through status and possessions. We shouldn't blame people that choose to spend their wealth on luxury cars, but blame often self destructive desire to copy these people while ignoring the hard work that these people put in to accrue that financial freedom.

I am not a big fan of this argument.  Happiness is an abstract concept that is nearly impossible to calculate. The fact that all 10 are either European or European off-shoot countries show that there is a bias.  Especially when the top 4 are all Scandinavian countries.  And actually, the people who top the list are Finnish people, but when asked if they believe they are the happiest people on Earth they will generally say no.  I think our society also has an unhealthy obsession with "being happy".  There is this expectation to be ecstatic about life all the time, and if you are not you are living life wrong.  However if you look at the population of the Finnish people, you will see they do not conform to our image of happy people.  This idea that you will be happy all the time is pushed on us by both companies and  movies such as happy, yet this is a Sisyphean goal. In life there will be times when bad things happen and people wont be happy, and we should not look down on those who are not.  And many times people are content with their life, and that is also looked down upon, as there is the expectation to always push yourself, but many people will be happy just living a normal life.

I think a big reason Americans are not as happy as maybe we should is because we are always looking at the people who have more.  If we were to line all the people in order of their wealth and access to public utilities, we are always looking forward at the people who have more, and there are a lot of people in front of the average American.  We either want to imitate the wealthy, trying to look like them by buying their clothes and driving nice cars, or we look at them with jealousy and blame them for all of the faults of our country.  However, if the average American were to turn around and see who is behind them, I think they would feel a rush of guilt for complaining.  One issue is that we have so much wealth it is nearly impossible for us to imagine the conditions of the Average person on earth.  I remember I lived in El Salvador for a few weeks.  On the wealth scale they are about the average country on Earth, give or take.  The standard of living is so much lower it is astounding.  Yet, there are billions of people who live with so much less.  I think one of the easiest ways to feel happier is to recognize these truths and to be grateful everyday for the privileges we have in our life.  As almost everyone who may read this comment is a student at UCSB, I think it is important to recognize that on a world scale, the opportunities presented to us put us in the top 1% of the 1% of the people on Earth.  There is a lot of worry in our world and we all face challenges everyday, but in the big scheme of things we will be alright.

It is the definition of success and happiness that is changing how people think in terms of how to make the best out of their life. And if people feel like what makes them happy is temporary recognition, fame, and more, then they will feel that rush, only to be quickly diminished. It is a bit superficial and may be there are people out there that get joy from being monetarily wealthy but there are also people out there that finds the most minimal things that make them happy. I guess it really depends on what kind of happy each individual person would like to achieve and I think once knowing that, they can dig deeper to see what the root of their desire is and how that can be the same collaterally. 
           <br><br>
In any case, much of the film talked to folx that are poor and have this mindset: "When we work in a community it makes you feel good that you can bring something to the table and help someone out." I feel the same about contributing to movements and bringing what I learned in school and communities back home to my family who can also benefit from this knowledge. One of the scenes that I really enjoyed was showing how Okinawan villagers get together weekly, strengthening intergenerational bonds and producing knowledge, being closer and closer to human-ness that we were meant to have. This is why co-op community housing is another goal to strive towards. In the US, $50,000 annual income needed to be able to sustain basic needs. I think that this number is bizarre and we never realize that it is and that we are just trying to survive under this capitalistic world that only serves the 1%. We are controlled by the wealthy people that don't mind being charged $4000 for rent.

 I really liked your outlook on the film "Happy". I believe working in a community and being of service for others should be the purpose of all of us. As you mentioned, the Okinawan villages get together weekly to spread positivity among others. If we all focusing on giving to one another, the world can become a happier place. I think this practice can be applied to a bigger sense. If we hold food co-ops and other organized community events, we can successfully spread awareness. I for one volunteered in a garden club during my high school years. My team was able to harvest vegetables and some fruits to give free of charge to homeless people as well as the cafeteria. If we're are able to set aside our differences and work together to be of service to people, this can have tremendous impacts on communities. I think that is the main objective we must have towards fighting climate change.

I agree with you. The film starts with the quote about the fundamental idea of American Dream, which is the pursuit of happiness. But the definition of happiness and the reason people feel that way varies case by case. People’s mood changes over time, but according to the film, 50% of the difference in the happiness level is due to the genes, which is called the genetic set point. People focus more on the wealth, social status and health, but those aspects only contribute to 10% in the happiness level. Surprisingly, the 40% that is left is due to the actions people choose to take each day. The sudden happy, sad or disappointment will not last for a long time, the key to happiness is whether people can manage their moods and turn their emotions back to the normal level of happiness. This film is the most interesting film I have watched in this quarter, because happiness is very important to every one of us that many people’s life goal is to be happy. A lot of people focus on the wrong parts of their lives to determine their happiness level that some of them believe they have to succeed or make enough money in order to be happy, but research have proved it wrong that most parts are determined by genes and others are determined by the actions people make, the smallest part is the things like wealth. The film inspires me to care less about the circumstances, because those things will not determine my happiness level, but to focus more on the choices I make each day and try my best to control my emotions back to the normal stage if I feel overly happy or sad.
<br><hr>
 i think you make a good point about finding the balance in your choices and circumstances. I think the key to happiness is knowing what you truly deeply want and strive towards it. The key is finding joy and pleasure in every little situation and events in time that leads you to your goal. Know that you are supported and loved and will accomplish many many things. This is what I feel would be great for humanity to strive towards and to shift gears.

I think that one of the greatest faults of America is the american dream. From a young age we are fed this narrative that says that we can be whatever we want to be (and what we want to be is successful). They then define this success as having a big house, a big family, and a job where you sit behind a desk and make money. It's the frame for every family movie. But what happens when those long hours add up to nothing, when the place you spend most of your day isn’t satisfying. Where do you turn when the dream you've been chasing your whole life doesn't pan out? This is the issue. We aren’t in a position to live our life because unlike many of the happiest countries, there is no support from the government. We don't have to be disgruntled with our position, but in comparison, we feel like we aren’t where we should be. This discontent can only be changed from the inside. It begins with a change of mind. 
<br><br>
One of the most interesting parts of the film was when they were talking about dopamine receptors, and the fact that they use the phrase “don't use em, lose em.” If we aren't stimulating ourselves in the correct ways, we suffer. Happiness isn't just a state of mind that feels good, it is good for our health. We can't function as well when we are depressed, we don't appreciate life the same way. Everyone has their hobbies, but I didn't realize just how important it was to do things that make you happy. People may have their separate baselines (accounting for 50% of their happiness) and some may be higher than others, but there is a huge swath of space that is up to the individual. Boxing yourself into something that makes you unhappy is setting yourself up to fail. 

<br><br>

I think changing this mindset may be up to people realizing that most of the things they have in their life are just fluff that we assign emotional value to so trick ourselves into being happy. It begins with realizing that we don't need all these things. Stripping away all the stuff until you have what you need, and then going from there. It means redefining success.

We are taught at a young age in this society that to bigger is better and to always strive to have more and more. Here in America, we associate material wealth with success. The more money you make the more successful you are. The bigger and grander your house is, the happier you will be. We do not feel satisfied, or happy,  if we are constantly longing for more, more wealth, more possessions, more greed. A great moment in the film, Happy, is when the other culture’s ways of life are shown and there is such a stark contrast between these lifestyles and the so called “American Dream.” 
 <br><br>

What I loved most about this film was the idea that our consumerist capitalistic culture degrades our way of life. The things we search for, all of these materialistic goals we strive for only bring about temporary feelings of satisfaction. The greed and the longing for more and more causes an infinite cycle of discontentment and the only way to break it is to focus on more meaningful connections to things and to stop always wanting more. The key to happiness is to want less and to practice mindfulness. Not only does this help to heal the soul damaged by consumer culture, it also helps to heal the Earth. Coinciding with the want for more and more, people seem to have no problem using and abusing the planet and its resources. In our culture, the need for material wealth always outranks the duty we should feel to protect and have respect for the other things we share the earth with. Consumer culture makes for people who are  too selfish to share and too greedy to stop and the Earth is only used as a tool to help obtain the dream of power and wealth.

The American Dream is destroying the planet as we believe that the more we have the happier we will be. This is proven to not be true because of hedonic adaptation. Hedonic adaptation Is when we get used to the new things that we have and are no longer satisfied and crave more.  We have grown up to believe that in order to be successful we need to have the biggest and newest things. Although, this is not true as American homes have increased in size and people have more now than they did in the past, yet people’s overall happiness has continued to stay the same. However, through the film Happy we see how in other countries where people have less things than Americans, they live happier lives because they are living simplistic lives. In the documentary they highlight the importance of humans having a connection with the people around them since this makes them feel like they matter. The most important thing for human is to have connections with the people and they feel like they belong in a family or community. It was interesting to see how people in Japan are dying because they are being overworked. They even have a word for the people who die from being overworked, and this all started after WW2 when Japan had to rebuild itself back up and the government emphasized the importance of economic prosperity. Other Western countries envied them, but this came with a price to the Japanese people, as they report being the unhappiest industrialized country. The reason why other countries are happier than Americans is because they live lives that do not revolve around work, but they have hobbies and interests that bring happiness into their lives. Since they do not work as much as American they have more time to spend time with their families. These countries also have governments where they take care of their citizens; they have universal healthcare, free education, maternity leave, and other benefits which Americans do not have and thus live a more stressful life.

There is no doubt that everyone wants to be happy, but people tend to have a different definition of happiness. In the movie Happy it discusses what brings joy for people. It was evident that the material good and money won’t bring real pleasure. People won’t need a booming economy such as the developing country like the US, per person made about 16 metric tons of CO2 but only rank as the 19th happiest country around the world. Contrast with other five happiest countries like Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and the Netherlands. Their emission is only about half of the US, even if their temperature is relatively low, which may consume more energy. The example of Costa Rica is also interesting, which reveals that again people don’t need that amount of money to be happy. One average American produces seven times of greenhouse emission as a happy person in Coast Rica. Poverty indeed makes people suffering, but after a certain amount of income about $40,000, the happiness is no longer depends on the wealth. From my personal experience, delight doesn’t depend on wealth and money. I gain happiness from the thing I am passionate about and also the care and love from my family. I used to enjoy the fake gratification of the material good, but it brings me nothing real, but only instant fulfillment.

We as humans are indeed destroying the planet in our endless pursuit of happiness which we will not find. Many people in this world believe that happiness can be found in the stuff they purchase. We live in such a materialistic world where everything someone owns has to be the best and the newest. If you don't have the newest thing on the block, you aren't successful in the eyes of today and in return you are not happy. Everyone in life just wants to be happy, but we are so misguided on how to obtain true happiness. The Indian man and his family who have virtually nothing were happier than the average American. He lives in a small house that is put together with scraps. He doesn't go out and eat luxurious food ever. His job consists of running and pulling people around town in a cart in all sorts of terrible weather conditions. Despite all of this he is still happy and does not complain. He focuses on the meaningful things in his life such as his neighbors, family, wife, and his whole entire life and what it has to offer. People in the U.S. believe that making a lot of money, owning cars, and owning houses will make you happy. Money can only provide happiness when it is enough to cover basic needs. While everyone is trying to keep buying their happiness, they are causing massive amounts of CO2 to be released into the atmosphere boosting global warming and climate change. We should focus on love and compassion. Treating others with love and equality is the only way to reach global happiness. Until we do so, we will just continue to destroy the earth in our endless cycle of consumerism. Consumerism will not make us happy. True connections with other people will. I really enjoyed this movie and found it very moving in certain parts of the movie. I hope the U.S. can be as happy as Denmark one day, and see people working together in their communities as they do.

Most people think if they have more money, they can become happier. However, according to the film and the video, it's actually the opposite. I think people should change their personal definition of happiness. Having the ability to buy more things doesn't mean we can all become happier. Sometimes money cannot buy happiness. In the film, people that live in poor countries that have less pressure and lower GDP are happier than people in countries that have lower GDP.  Higher GDP often means developed countries that emit more CO2. Therefore for some people, working harder doesn't mean happier. By putting too much pressure on ourselves can make us less happy and even harm the environment.

I definitely agree with the idea that most people think that more money equals more happiness. Like the documentary pointed out, this is wrong on so many levels. Money and social status only accounts to 10% of our happiness while our genes and the actions we partake in, make up 50% and 40% respectively. As a society, we have all fallen into this trap of mass consumerism and the need for materialistic goods to make ourselves happy. We constantly strive for more wealth, more items, more status, all in the hopes of becoming happy. This mentality that more stuff makes us happy is what is truly making us unhappy in the first place. Everyone is so stressed about making more money and having more stuff that they fail to see that simple things make us so much happier than material goods can. I really enjoyed the parts of the documentary where they showed us how even the poorest people can be happy. They are happy just being around their friends and family and don’t need any of the other stuff that people who live in more developed countries constantly stress about.

It’s sad to see how the people of Japan are so unhappy with their life, despite living in a country with a highly developed economy and one of the highest GDP in the world. People in Japan feel the need to constantly work and make money to be seen as successful. They literally work themselves to death and many of their working population are under a lot of stress. This is in contrast to the people living in Okinawa, Japan. From what we saw in the documentary, many in their population live to old ages and are living their best life. People there are definitely more happy than those who live elsewhere in Japan. This goes to show that you do not need a lot of things in life to be happy and that money can’t buy true happiness.

To get straight to the point, we are absolutely destroying the planet in a misguided pursuit of happiness. The “American Dream” is an idea of ultimately acquiring happiness through first acquiring all of the material possessions and success that your heart desires. In no way is this a reality, and this concept is accurately named a dream because, as we can see in this film and by just looking around us, happiness is not achieved this way. The seven happiest countries in the world create so much less damage to the environment than does the United States. This is because the style in which they live is not centered around stereotypical success, material gain, and wealth. In attempting to live the “American Dream,” Americans have turned away from sharing, helping, and bettering the lives of others or of the planet because as they reach for this  goal, they feel that being selfish is a necessity. Americans are notorious for holding close what  they have and taking what they can without considering the effects. American success can be easily described as a dog-eat-dog world, in which people will do whatever it takes to be successful, even if it means stepping on others to reach the top. In this way, yes “success” may be reached, but happiness is still a just a dream for many. The happiest countries focus on the things that boost happiness in others and  are therefore rewarded with happiness for themselves. What our culture hasn’t been able to understand is that there may be a different definition of success that involves happiness rather than monetary gain. Maybe then Americans could begin to reduce their negative impact on the planet in realizing that environment-harming possessions are not what produce lasting satisfaction or happiness.

Pursuing happiness should be a free-cost thing to do, which can be achieved by everyone on earth. However, people nowadays seem to catch the wrong point of so-called happiness, we filled our empty hearts with fast food, over-consumption and even alcohol.
 <br><br>

This is wrong, happiness can only be obtained by being who you really want to be and cherish everyone around you. The key factors of happiness is being in good relationships with your families and friends, respecting everything and every creature on earth, and waiting and ready for new adventure. This, which in turn, indicates we should protect earth, where our as human beings' roots are.
 <br><br>

Fast food is bad for our health, over-consumption is both a waste of resources and money, drinking alcohol and liquor can only hurt your body without healing inner pain. Go out and take adventure, meet new people, enjoy times with the loved ones. Those activities are free and you can take whenever you can. Always have gratitude to the nature.
 <br><br>

The right way to love yourself and the earth is never doing things harm to yourself or the nature. People today are misguided with the pursuits of happiness, maybe take time and just think about am I doing the right thing to the earth, and you will come up with your answer.

The Declaration of Independence says that people hold “…certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
 <br><br>

It seems that we have forgotten about this essential piece if our society.
 <br><br>
The importance of being happy and making others happy.
 <br><br>

Our communities are built upon greedy, unhappy pyramids rather than circular, connected webs that connect us to one another. Within our societies, if we focused less on material wealth and more on the happiness that our relationships in life can bring us, the world would be a better, brighter, and greener place. If we built up our relationships with one another and with the Earth before building up capital and excessive wealth, then maybe we would all be happier. Isn’t every other Hollywood movie built around how “money can’t buy happiness”? The main character is seeking fortune when they realize love is all they need. Flynn Rider from Tangled thinks he needs wealth to be happy, but then he meets Rapunzel. Ebenezer Scrooge is a cruel and unhappy man until he mends his relationships with the people around him and his community, choosing to stop focusing on his hoarded wealth and instead finding value and happiness in sharing it and focusing more on his happiness. It’s a tale as old as time, and yet our society still can’t turn its cheek on consumerism. We have spiraled further and further from a society that seeks the pursuit of happiness and have instead turned to the pursuit of wealth. To what ends? When is the wealth enough? Or does it never end? People say that they need to be wealthy to be happy, but who ever said that you needed one for the other? Who connected those two dots between wealth and happiness? I understand from personal experience that it’s hard not to think about money when you aren’t financially stable, but there are still so many little things that come at no cost that can bring you happiness. Family, friends, loved ones, nature; they’re all there for us and provide us irreplaceable resources in our lives, the most important of those resources being love.
 <br><br>

This all seems like a daunting task seeing the hate and fear that seems to dominate in the media, but it starts with one heart at a time. Also, as we see in the movie, it’s already being done in other communities around the world, so we know it’s possible to build our communities around happiness. 
 <br><br>

Finally, the middle school where the school scene was filmed was in my middle school: Benicia Middle School, so I’ve seen this movie a few times in school (often with pride and excitement at seeing our school up there). :)

I think it's interesting that the Declaration of Independence mentioned the pursuit of happiness as an unalienable right, but does not mention happiness as one. In other words, you have the right to look for happiness all you want, but you are never guaranteed to find it. Throughout the years, Americans have looked for happiness in different places, and I think the American Dream is what they thought was the epitome of it. If you had a job, a house, a car, and a family, you had it all. But that didn't satisfy us for long. In modern society, happiness is defined more and more by materialistic possessions. It's what we've learned previously in this course: people will buy stuff that will temporarily make them happy, and give them the illusion that their life is good, but the joy will fade, and they'll find other ways to satisfy themselves. In the film they talk about extrinsic and intrinsic goals, and I think society is currently obsessed with extrinsic goals: money, success, etc., instead of focusing on what matters: internal peace and satisfaction. Until we learn to live without the fear of being judged, I don't think we will pursue true happiness.
